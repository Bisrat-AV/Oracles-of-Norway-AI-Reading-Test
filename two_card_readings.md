# Deck: SENSITIVE SOUL

## Radiant Light
This card represents gifts and recognition.It speaks of a person who has done
immense inner work and has tapped into the sacred radiant light.
This light is the energy and vibration of happiness—
not superficial,
not material.
It is a happiness that comes from being awake in life,
in tune with your abilities and innate talents,
and able to express them without hindrance, shame, fear, or distortion.
Through this, the person brings forth creative work that vibrates with sacred energy,
allowing others to feel it,
receive nourishment, healing, inspiration, and relief.
This creative expression can take many forms:
Artwork, paintings, images, books, writing
Music
Therapeutic modalities the person works with
Or simply the person themselves—
someone who has become a golden being,
a person with sparkling eyes who has a healing effect on others.
It can also signify someone who can enter and transform difficult environments—
conflicts,
dysfunctional relationships,
spaces with locked or isolated energy.
They can often be amazing therapists or healers,working with people trapped in
heavy, stagnant situations.
Overall, this is a joyful card of:
Success,
Fulfillment,
Completeness,
Having conquered one’s inner karmic skeletons,
And discovered true, lasting value.
---

## Toxic Energy
This is the direct opposite of Radiant Light.
It represents:
Low-frequency energy,
Bad intentions,
Dark emotions—
envy,
blame,
scheming,
manipulation.
It can also point to narcissistic energy:
People who lie to save face,
Who care nothing for truth,
Focused only on control, power, and self-interest,
Absent of empathy, clarity, and sacred light.
---

### Radiant Light and Toxic Energy
Their meaning depends on the question and the person’s context.
1. If the person is seeking healing:
It is clear that there is potential for deep healing from difficult energies.
Toxic energy often represents other people—or sometimes one’s own very
negative thought patterns, such as being overly critical and focused on
others’ flaws.
In that case, the advice is to surrender everything to the divine and begin
walking the true spiritual path.
1. If Radiant Light appears first, it often signals:
The person themselves does not carry the toxicity.
The toxic energy comes from others, from the environment, society, or
envious people.
The guidance is to:
Protect and guard oneself,
Maintain high standards,
Refuse to be pulled down,
Avoid judging the toxic people.
Instead, hold them in light,send love, andwish them well.
1. Another interpretation:
If the person wants to grow and rise further, this combination may
encourage them to actively clear out toxic relationships and
environments.
It can be an invitation to take on such tasks, because this person may have
extraordinary healing abilities and can help bring light to distorted
situations.
The message is to not fear toxic energy,but to see it as light that has been
distorted,and to hold firmly to the true radiant light.
This allows:
Situations to heal,
Great improvements to occur,
And the person to fully embrace their role as a light-bringer.
---

## Roots
This card carries multiple meanings, and its interpretation depends on the person
asking the question and the energy they bring.
Are they seeking help and guidance?
Or are they simply looking for a boost or confirmation?
Positive meaning
The card can indicate that:
Old roots have been cut away,
A much better life situation is on its way,
New crops will grow because new seeds have been sown,
The old phase is over, completely ended at the root.
This is a strong and positive message, signifying that:
A cycle has ended,
A karmic circle has been completed,
And a long-standing problem is finally over.
You will no longer receive the old patterns, because the roots have been cut.If
anything from the past shows up, it is only residue—no new growth will come from
the old because the root is gone.
This is a powerful card of new beginnings, signaling:
Completely new results
A completely different life
When the old is not yet cut away
If the person cannot cut away the old, they may feel:
Continuous disappointments,
That the past keeps repeating itself.
In that case, the card means:
You haven’t fully cut the root yet.
You need to become very conscious about how you use your tools:
Your thinking,
What you validate,
How you use and manage your daily time,
And how responsible you are for your own energy and choices.
If you are still:
Projecting onto others,
Avoiding truly feeling what your own body and emotions are telling you,
Clinging to others,
Being difficult to deal with,
And not learning from the past,
…then the card warns:
You will recreate the old again.
The cycles will repeat,
And the karmic lessons will come around again until you finally understand,
learn, and commit to daily inner work
---
## Blister
This card directly represents repeating the mistakes of the past.
It is:
Wearing the same old shoes,
Even though you know they hurt,
They give you blisters,
But you keep walking in them anyway.
It is continuing to:
Seek love where it doesn’t exist,
Put yourself in situations where you suffer,
Project your unresolved feelings onto others,…even though you know better.
Blister urges:
Throw away the old shoes.
Learn from life’s lessons.
---
### Roots and Blister
When Uprooted and Blister appear together, they clearly speak of:
Repetition of the past,
The need to understand the cycles,
Learning karmic lessons to break free.
If lessons are not learned, the same experiences will return.
It is no use complaining,
Because it is the result of your own choices—or lack of them.
The core message is:
See reality clearly,
Become a responsible and conscious human being,
You reap what you sow.
We are divine creators,
And life will always reflect what we plant.
Alternative scenario: a message of hope
If the person:
Seeks comfort or healing,
Has already made many hard choices,
Done a lot of inner work,
But still feels exposed to injustice or deprived of what they deserve,
…then these two cards can carry a very positive message:
You will receive what you deserve.
The old truly has been cut away.
New times are coming.
The curse is broken.
The old shoes are gone—you will never wear them again.
You have:
Learned your karmic lessons,
Grown spiritually,
Chosen much better for yourself.
The results of that inner work are on their way,
Even if it always takes time for the outer reality to catch up.
Now comes:
A new life,
Completely new experiences,
Results that do not hurt you,
And the old cycles are finally left behind forever.
---
## Home Environment
This card represents what you grew up with.
It can reflect how things are at home now: your family situation, partner, and
children.
It can also point to your closest network, the relationships and constellations you
are part of.
The card indicates that our home environments often mirror the ones we grew up in.
When you grow up playing a certain role, you tend to continue playing that role. As
an adult, you often attract people who resemble the family members you had before.
This shows that there are deep, fundamental patterns in society and within the
psyche that are completely invisible, yet they work so deeply that they influence the
way people think and behave.
When you have a specific role and step out into the world—
into a completely new arena like work, a school, a new class,
into an environment where everything is seemingly new—
…at first, you may be perceived differently.
But over time, this invisible pattern begins to activate.
The subconscious mind starts to take over,
And the initial first-impression snapshots fade.
Gradually, through shared experiences, people begin to see you in the role you
have always carried.
It takes a lot to truly be seen in a new way—unless you yourself have fully broken out
of that role.
This is why people are often treated similarly wherever they go, once time passes and
interactions deepen.
The card reminds you that:
The way things are at home, you carry with you into all other relationships.
Having harmony and well-being at home is essential, because it affects how you
experience relationships outside the home.
---
## Vitamin
This is a positive and uplifting card that represents all that strengthens and nourishes
you.
It’s not just about:
food,
healthy routines,
diet and exercise,
or positive thinking.
It’s about everything that dissolves the lies about who you are—everything that
allows you to fully relax and feel aligned with your authentic self.
The body becomes able to rebalance itself for a calmer nervous system.The breath
can move deeper into the body.
This can involve:
Mantras, sound, vibrations,
The right people,
And perhaps soul connections that arrive as a kind of free assistance.
When you come together with these people, miracles seem to happen, because:
You share a long history on a soul level,
You bring out the best in each other,
There is no competition,
And your connection is nonkarmic.
These are people who do not enter your life to deliver karmic lessons.Instead, they
bring grace and support, only positive energy.
Encountering such people is a powerful indication that you are in the presence of the
right person—they are like bursting, radiant vitamins.
---
### Home Environment and Vitamin
When we see the Vitamin card together with Home Environment, it reinforces the
message of:
How vital it is to feel well at home.
If you don’t feel good at home, then:
You need to take action.
You need the right vitamins to thrive in your home life.
This can mean:
Changing things in your home,
Making significant adjustments,
Or even changing homes entirely.
Vitamins are what they are—it is your job to identify the best “vitamins” for you and
take them.
If a vitamin for you is to move to a better home environment,
Or to create better conditions in your current home,
Then that is the step you are being guided to take.
Together, these two cards point to taking deep care of yourself and taking your
health and wellbeing seriously.
The Vitamins can help you improve your home environment and your life overall.
Alternative scenarior
If a person already has harmonious home conditions, is generally healthy, and
thriving, then this card can carry another meaning:
The person themselves is the vitamin.
They function as a nourishing presence for:
their home environment,
their relationships,
and the groups they are part of.
They are a source of replenishment and positive energy for others.
In the context of Home Environment, this could apply to:
Family,
Children,
A spouse or partner,
Close friends,
Or even students, if the person is a teacher.
A teacher, for example, could be a vitamin for the children:
They vibrate light and warmth,
They offer supportive, nourishing energy,
And the children can feed on this energy in the sense of receiving emotional
sustenance.
Children always need support and guidance from adults, and in such a reading, the
Vitamin card signifies that this person is that source of nourishment.

## The Thermometer
This card measures feelings, situations, environments, and relationships, and it is in
search of the inner vibe, the vibration, that “gut feeling,” that sensory impression you
get when you tune into something and it gives you information about whether it is
good for you or not.
This card indicates that it may be important to develop an inner thermometer—a
sense that can tune into people, relationships, work, choices you need to make, and
other life situations to get that immediate yes or no feeling.
Usually, when this card appears, it suggests that you need this ability because you
might be making choices that don’t align with your body’s signals. Ignoring the
body’s signals and the way it communicates can lead to many negative
consequences.
It can grow into larger problems that must be dealt with later. You might also enter
difficult relationships that are hard to break free from—or at the very least, you might
pay a high price to free yourself from dysfunctional connections and people.
The thermometer is therefore a golden tool, one that the person should develop and
learn to understand deeply.
However, there is also a caution:
Do not misread the thermometer.
Avoid becoming overly eager, reading energies in others that are not actually
there.
Because this card is ultimately about your own signals.
It is important to distinguish between:
1. A true energetic reading of a situation, person, or relationship, and
2. Your own internal fear, paranoia, or projections.
---
## Ananda
This card represents the spiritual home—a sacred state of liberation and elevation, of
being in union with all life.
Ananda is a celebration of:
our spiritual origin,
the beautiful vibration that we all are,
the core essence of life itself.
It is also connected to the Higher Self. This card speaks of being attuned to your
Higher Self, making conscious choices, and breaking free from old programming and
repetitive patterns.
It is about recognizing and surrendering to the vibration and essence that is truly you
—the authentic and eternal part of you.
---
### The Thermometer and Ananda
There is little doubt about the message:
The Thermometer is to be used to identify the vibration of Ananda.
To recognize the vibration of your Higher Self, and to surrender to it.
The guidance is to stop making choices that continue old patterns, ignorance, or
darkness. Instead, it is about creating the opportunity for a transition of
consciousness—a more stable shift into higher awareness, where we can humanize
our spiritual essence and live from it.
This is a beautiful message:
Use the thermometer to pick up on the spiritual essence,
And allow that to guide your choices and align your energy.
An alternative scenario
If the person pulling these cards is in chaos, pain, or deep struggle, they may find it
hard to relate to the higher spiritual message.
They might have real-life challenges,
Conflicts with toxic people,
Difficult family or work situations that demand immediate attention.
When the human pain is very strong, that becomes the focus, and it overshadows the
spiritual essence.
In this case, the guidance shifts:
The person must use the thermometer to identify the source of pain (the
“abscess” or core wound).
Once it is found, surrender it to divine guidance and healing—to the energy of
Ananda.
Practical steps may be required:
End unhealthy relationships or patterns,
Withdraw from toxic environments,
Seek retreat or safe space to reconnect,
Invite high-frequency, healing energy that will also clear the mind, allowing better
decisions and clarity to emerge.
In such cases, Ananda can even be used as a mantra for coping with pain and
invoking healing.
---
## The Short Journey
This card is about life’s journey. But it is a journey of consciousness—a symbolic
journey rather than a literal one. It’s not about traveling across Asia right now, but
about the inner, symbolic path we walk.
On this journey, you might climb mountains, or fly in a plane that bypasses the
hardships and makes the journey easier. Sometimes you may swim in the ocean,
struggling with all the strength you have, and other times you might ride a scooter
straight ahead with no effort or cost.
This represents our journey of awareness. Sometimes we receive help; sometimes
grace strikes. We get the wind at our back, helping us out of difficult situations. Life
may place the right people in our path at the right time, offering gifts, solving
challenges, and opening doors for us.
But this journey can also bring challenging people at the perfect time—because there
are thresholds we must overcome and painful feelings we must face. Often it is other
people who trigger these feelings, or rejections, dismissals, and situations that
awaken wounds, shame, defeat, or fear.
The journey is ultimately about moving out of illusions and pain, because the higher
purpose is the soul’s path. We are spiritual beings having experiences here, but we
are never bound by those experiences. They can never define who we truly are.
When we start to live from this understanding, we break the link to the sources of
suffering—loss, rumination, negative self-images. We gain new eyes on the path of
life and begin to perceive what is truly real. We become capable of experiencing
nature, other people, moments, and the elements in a wondrous way, unfiltered by
the mind and its definitions.
This card reflects that path and is deeply encouraging, asking the person to keep
moving forward, to remain courageous and brave, to trust in life’s forces and the
journey itself.
---
## The Circle
This card represents the inner, private life—the world that lives within each of us. It is
as if each of us is a small island, and everything happening on that island is our inner
world.
This card speaks to:
The environment and climate on that island.
The boundaries around it.
Our responsibility for what grows there.
We are the ones who must cultivate the land, plow the fields, clear and nurture our
space, and maintain clean and healthy air around us. We not only hold this
responsibility, but we also have full authority over what grows on our inner island
and how we keep it clear.
No one else has the right to decide anything about that island or its inner climate.
Yet, often other people may have a grip on someone’s inner life if they are used to
controlling or dominating that person.
If a person does not take command of their life—does not claim their power—then
the “island” is left open, its windows unguarded, and it is easy for others to enter and
do as they please.
This card encourages setting boundaries and protecting the inner life. Just as the skin
protects the inner organs, we must also protect our aura—created through our
thoughts and self-validation. A strong and radiant aura keeps negative intentions and
toxic energies away.
---
### The Short Journey and The Circle
Together, these cards suggest that:
Gaining clarity over one’s inner climate
Taking responsibility for it
Establishing healthy boundaries
…are essential parts of the life journey at this moment. This is the way to create a
more livable daily life, less influenced by invasive energies from others. With this
comes less pain and greater clarity.
Alternative interpretation
If the person asking already has strong boundaries, lives responsibly with high
consciousness, and is well along the awakening path, then this spread can mean
something else:
They are an important person for others’ journeys out of illusion.
They may work in collaboration or community, bringing upliftment and clarity to
the collective.
It can indicate a strong team, a healthy community, a work environment, or a
project where aligned people work toward a shared goal.
In this sense, the cards show both a personal and a collective path, reflecting inner
strength and positive influence in the world.
---
## The Mask
This card is about how people wear masks. It can signify dishonesty and the act of
playing a game. It suggests that someone may not be honest with their intentions,
that they are trying to control outcomes by playing that game to achieve personal
gain.
This card can also represent the roles that all humans take on while on Earth. All the
masks of the human experience—our human identity—is full of roles and things we
identify with, which together form a “mask.”
If, for example, you grew up as the black sheep, a kind of scapegoat, then you have
identified with having flaws, with not belonging, with not being in the spotlight or
achieving success. It can then be difficult to truly feel good about yourself because
you are acting out a role of smallness and woundedness.
This card can therefore be interpreted in different ways.
---
## The Abuser
This is a very uncomfortable energy, representing people who overstep, break
boundaries—other people’s boundaries—and exploit or misuse others in various
ways.
This card can manifest in many degrees:
It can point to very serious situations.
Or it can refer to less severe patterns.
The text on this card is usually long and gives a thorough introduction to the
characteristics of the abuser. It also explains what makes a person attract such
people, and how the victim’s energy leaks, drawing them into relationships with this
type of person.
---
### The Mask and The Abuser
The meaning depends on who is asking for the reading.
Scenario 1: If this is someone who genuinely carries the role of the weak link, the
scapegoat, has endured a lot of suffering, is used to giving away their power
and space, and generally may be a people pleaser or even self-sabotaging—
then the “Abuser” card highlights the influence in this person’s life.
The message is clear: they must work on their own boundaries and inner
life. They need to take concrete steps to break free from unhealthy
relationships and people.
It is also crucial to understand that when one validates these limited
roles—like the scapegoat role—one makes oneself a target. It’s as if you’re
pouring out your own water. You become self-offering.
This is when the energy represented by “The Abuser” comes in, in
various forms, to take advantage. They may expect too much, take too much,
treat the person poorly, and essentially use their energy.
Scenario 2: If the person asking does not carry the scapegoat role, things can be
different. They may struggle with honesty themselves. They may have thick
armor, find it hard to be feminine, receptive, vulnerable, or visible.
In this case, they might wear a powerful mask of entitlement and
confidence, being forceful or assertive. Here, the “Abuser” card might reflect
what they themselves could become.
Even though “abuser” is a strong word, it can simply mean overstepping
others’ boundaries and misusing their energy. This comes from a lack of inner
balance and honesty in self-expression, which can harm others.
They might unintentionally become someone others experience as:
an abuser,
an energy thief,
or simply someone they cannot relax around.
The Two Cards as a Wake-Up Call
In this context, the two cards together serve as a wake-up call and a guide to:
Remove the mask
Feel the fresh air
Embrace the freedom and peace that comes with honesty
When one dares to drop the mask and be authentic, they naturally become:
kinder
more transparent
more loving toward others
---
## Honey Tears
The first card, Honey Tears, speaks of the releasing tears. These are not the tears you
cry from suffering or despair, but tears that come when you surrender to release —
the power of transformation — when you finally let go of the pain and the story that
has carried the pain. All the old things you still hold onto.
This is a very good energy because it leads to rejuvenation, renewal, and a blissful,
ecstatic joy that can wash through the body in the time ahead. It’s not something you
can plan for or force; it comes through grace. It’s as if you have made good choices,
and in the right moment, you choose to surrender. Then, the releasing tears may
suddenly come, truly freeing you from pain, suffering, and anxiety.
---
## The Flame
Represents the healing and purifying energy that exists in many forms. You can call
upon it through specific figures, such as archangels, Jesus, spiritual light beings, and
angels. But you can also call upon it in the form of your Higher Self and your soul,
and of course, the universal light and the absolute, all-encompassing vibration.
The Flame is extremely healing. This card also invites you to remember that there
may be other people who share the same vibe, the same flame, the same energy and
frequency as you. Finding your authentic tone and daring to express it fully can
attract others who recognize it. This is not about what you think or about being
judged; it’s simply that they will feel the similarity in vibration. This can bring you
together with the right people, the right groups — those that bring real growth,
success, and progress — and what truly matters for your development.
When these two cards come together, they form a powerful energy station. They
speak of great potential for change, great potential for healing and improvement,
and the possibility of finally completing a situation that has been wearing you down,
so that you feel upgraded. The way there is to be truly honest, authentic in your
expression, and true to what you know is right and true. Let go of the stories, allow
yourself to be touched by these energies, and trust. Let go of controlling the process
yourself.
---
### Honey Tears and The Flame
speak of enormous potential and powerful forces at work, and that now is truly the
time to surrender even more.
Depending on the person’s question, the interpretation can shift:
If they ask about another person, or about work or something not directly related
to healing, these cards point to perfect constellations and ideal environments
as potential. The person can step into these by being in flow, following
synchronicities, and staying true to themselves — this will draw the right
people to them. The cards also say: let go of the need to control, to search, and
to over-analyze. Instead of weighing every decision back and forth, be more of
a witness and be willing to be unorthodox — to see things in a new way.
This is about forces that work with their own frequency and intelligence, and
surrendering to that is the key.
If the person is in crisis and needs healing, this is an extremely positive card
combination.
If they are asking for inspiration or want to manifest something, the cards say
there is healing power and the ability to tap into what is not commonly
accessed — a depth within themselves that can now be brought to the surface.
This can inspire and allow them to bring something new into the world,
influencing others through creative paintings, music, colors, frequencies, and
sounds — creations that can carry healing for others and have a profound
effect on them.
---
## Childhood
This card represents childhood and the work of healing oneself by working with the
inner child — and sometimes with other children — to release old sorrow and
transform what has happened. It is about recognizing that you carry the little child
within you, and that you can go and meet that child to make things better.
It’s as if that child is still there in your old childhood home, and you can change the
space — making it safe, bright, and good — so that the child feels secure,
comfortable, and able to move on from the memories or difficulties it has held.
---
## Freedom to Be Yourself
This card stands for having the space to move freely, to express yourself openly, to
breathe deeply when you speak with people — breathing deep into your belly, feeling
safe and open in your chest to express your needs, to say “no” when you mean it and
“yes” when you want to, and to dance or move without shame or restrictions.
---
## Childhood and Freedom to Be Yourself
they say that the solution lies in the childhood. It lies in freeing the child from its
restrictions and the difficulties that have shaped and programmed you as you are
today. If the inner child is still holding onto feelings of being trapped, shamed, or
fearful, it cannot pass through those emotions — and when they arise, they stop you
from moving forward.
These cards say: you were created to move freely, to breathe deeply, to be here in the
present moment. The solution lies in lifting the child up, freeing it from those
circumstances, and allowing the associated difficult feelings to flow through the body
without interference — without resistance, suppression, or judgment.
If, for example, the person asking the question is not working with healing but simply
wants to manifest something or find inspiration, this combination can point toward
all forms of free expression. It could be dance, expressing through music or
movement, or other creative outlets. It can also involve spending time with children,
observing how they behave before they are conditioned — and perhaps even
working with children directly, which can be deeply inspiring and very fitting.
It can refer to anything that encourages free expression — workshops, courses, or
even inspiring others to put down their burdens and embrace greater joy in life.
Together, these cards are joyful: they speak of joy growing and bringing the freedom
to be yourself, and of the many ways this can come into your life.
---
## Grow Inward
This card speaks of gaining clarity when you turn your focus inward. Stop focusing on
others — the solution is to focus within. If you do the inner work, it will be reflected
outward, making you stronger and more grounded. You will feel better, create more,
and reap greater rewards, even if, on the outside, it may not look that way.
The inner work doesn’t always show itself immediately — just like in the image,
something grows and sprouts without being visibly apparent from the outside. Then
suddenly it appears, and it comes through entirely — radiating through the aura,
shining through the eyes, resonating in the voice, in the tone and pitch of the voice,
and in your actions without you even thinking about it.
It reflects where you are within yourself — whether you are sitting in the center of
yourself or out at the periphery, distracted, stressed, disconnected. This card points
to the path back to your own center.
---
## The Window
This card stands for different perceptions — that people see things differently
because they have different viewpoints. Looking from the inside out and from the
outside in offers different perspectives. It is important to understand that people
come from different places, and you cannot assume they will see or think the same
as you.
The card also advises, regarding yourself, not to be fixed in your own ideas of who
you are or how you appear. Be generous, spacious, and almost neutral toward
yourself so that things can move freely, and your true beauty can shine through
without interruption or interference.
---
### Grow Inward and The Window
When Grow Inward and The Window appear together, they tell you not to focus on
others or be overly concerned about what others think, nor to judge them. Instead,
turn your gaze inward, take care of your own matters, and remember that you live
first and foremost within yourself — as does everyone else. We all see, feel, and think
through our own filters.
This awareness prevents misunderstandings and helps you interact on the right
terms.
Depending on the Question
If the person is asking for inspiration — for example, to write — these cards could
suggest writing about cultural differences, the importance of the inner journey
no matter who you are, and the reality that everyone acts from behind their
own filters. When you see clearly, you won’t judge anyone. This can be an
important lesson to share.
If the person is asking about work or making a choice, this can be read as the
card’s direct message: clarity is coming. It’s a positive sign — a “yes” — as
clarity will help you understand where others are coming from. The image of
the window shows that by looking through it, you gain new insight. This
suggests that the clarity you seek will arrive soon.
