## The Yellow Light, The Mailbox, Sparkle in the Eye, Brown field, Waves in the Sea
So here are the five cards: The Yellow Light, the Mailbox, Spark in the Eye, the Brown Mark, and Waves in the Sea.
A general message:
We see that there is a Brown Mark – there is a negative influence. There is something that is not working at all. And it can be a person who is not functioning and who creates trouble. And the reason we can say this is because we see Waves in the Sea, which means influence. It is influence from someone else’s pond, someone else’s waves, others creating unrest in your life. That I can see.
And then we also see that there is Spark in the Eye, so you should not overreact to this. You should not take it so terribly seriously. You should actually be a little lenient, and even laugh at it. And at least not allow it to affect your mood and your choices, for example. You should not become afraid of it or begin to act too much upon it.
And then we also see that you have the Yellow Light, which stands for your consciousness. You are real, and you have a clear and distinct voice. You do things correctly, you are concerned that things should be true and fair. And that is a very noble quality, and we see that. And I see that it is an influence that may indicate that it comes from you, the one who has received these cards. But it can also represent help and assistance, either from the spiritual side, that help comes from the universe, or that it can be other people coming in with these qualities.
For we see here the Mailbox, which means that messages are coming, or help, or something else that is in your favor – something positive. So it can represent that good things are coming in that balance out a little of what you are standing in. And it could well be that it is about being offered a new job, or a new place to live, or that there are other people who will help lighten some of what you are going through. And that it will become easier for you to leave the negative behind, because good messages have come in.
So there is always a very uplifting direction here. And I can say that because you see Spark in the Eye, and you see that the person, or the environment, or whatever it is that is represented by the Brown Mark, will not have such a lasting or deep impact. And there are very good forces here that are watching over and ensuring that everything will be very, very okay.

## Ghost, The Isolated Mind, The barn, Snow Dust, Money in the Bank
So we move to a new five-card reading. We have Ghost, we have the Isolated Mind, we have the Locked Door, we have Snow Dust, and we have Money in the Bank.

So, immediately, as a general message: a bit of uncomfortable influences here with Ghost, the Isolated Mind, and the Locked Door. I would say here it is an influence coming from controlling people who are not well with themselves. Who lack light, lack circulation and progress, who sit in bitterness and anger, and who do not want to change anything. They will not take advice, they just say no, they slam the door, they are stubborn and difficult, and they would rather decide everything and control each other. It is an incredibly uncomfortable and immovable energy.

So if this is about an influence the person is standing in, then you can say that the advice is simply to turn your nose another way, to move away from that influence. And there is indeed a nice message here with Snow Dust and Money in the Bank, which shows that things in life can suddenly take another direction. All by themselves. That there just comes help, like a magical sprinkle into life. Just like when it suddenly snows from one day to the next, then everything looks different. And the cards show that things can suddenly look different.

And that becomes very beneficial, because Money in the Bank can mean that you get help and support, and that you come out of a situation in a very good way. But generally it represents resources and access to life force, access to all the good things in life, which you will then have in the bank, or have in yourself, have in your life. And it is something that comes completely suddenly. Therefore, it is also a very encouraging message here, which shows that you should just close the door, and slam shut the door to that influence.

And it is about not reacting too much to that type of people who actually want you to react. Because then they can start some conflict, where they draw energy from you through your time and your resources and your investment of feelings and energy. The very best is not to answer and not to react at all, so that they do not get any energy from you. And you do not go into conflict with this type of people.

You can say: if this is someone who, for example, asks for healing, then clearly this can show both an influence one has in life that comes from others, but it can of course also show the person themselves – that the person is closed off and very shut down, and that they are very controlling and difficult to deal with. And that healing is about creating movement in the energy, creating healing, putting aside all that willpower and stopping the need to control things. That is what will help, and then life will suddenly open up, and things can resolve themselves greatly.

We see here with Snow Dust and Money in the Bank that there are good forces that can come in and reward you for that work. So it can be interpreted like that, and that is why it can be useful for the person to add an extra comment, or perhaps to first say something about their situation, in order to get the right way to interpret this. This will be different depending on whether it concerns the person who has this closedness, or whether it is a person who is themselves exposed to such difficult people who are very troublesome and hostile. That will determine how we interpret this.

And I also want to add that, since Ghost is here, I would say that it can be about other people this is dealing with. So one can also see it this way – that if one is unsure whether it is about the person themselves or about influences around the person, then sometimes it can be the card that decides. When Ghost comes, which in this context I read as a very controlling and invading energy – because ghosts invade life – then it is not the person themselves it is about, it is another who is doing it. And then it is that person who has the isolated mind.

## Bird cacophony , Southern bridge, Alternative route, Seaweed, Fjord
So here are five new cards: Bird Cry, Bridge to the South, Alternative Path, Seaweed, and Fjord.

Here we can identify the problem areas. We have Bird Cry, we have Seaweed, and we have Fjord. These show that there are a number of uncomfortable feelings present. A number of unclear things. It is difficult to shed light on what it is about. Difficult to see things directly – because of the Fjord, which represents that things are hidden. Or things may even be unconscious. Not aware of them. One may be driven by intentions, but not aware of the intentions that others have. And there can be secrets going on. That things are happening behind your back.

And we see with Seaweed that it is a card that stands for bad feelings and uncomfortable feelings. But they are not always entirely real. So we have to look at other cards. But since Fjord is here, which stands for something hidden, then it may be somewhat real here. It may be somewhat real that there can be dishonesty and that things are being hidden. Bird Cry is a kind of comments and behavior that are unpleasant, not entirely understandable, and that can trigger fear and stressful thoughts. That is what we see.

And then we have received two explanatory cards with Alternative Path and Bridge to the South. For they show that there is another way here. Another direction. Another path. And Bridge to the South can represent a transition to something new. And it can have to do with something south of you. That is, south of something. If you live in the north, then it is more to the south. It becomes a different climate. A different way of thinking. Different types of people. A different environment. And it always becomes better. Because there are lots of flowers on that side. So things become much better when you make that choice.

And in addition, we also see Alternative Path, which stands for the ability to choose not to take things so literally. Not read everything literally. But that you almost see that the path goes above the ordinary road. It goes up into the clouds. And it is a path that is very safe and good to take. And it will make sense when you first start to take that path. So it is a kind of advice about living with your soul. That is, having a much greater perspective on everything that happens. And therefore not going into fear. But instead identifying with the spiritual path and seeing things from above. But also, at the same time, it is braver to dare to make choices. To make new choices that move away from what is false here. Because there is absolutely nothing indicating that one should remain and deal with the problems. But here the cards show a way out, that there is real dishonesty or hidden intentions. And that it is wise to find other ways. That is the general message.

You can say that if this was a person asking and wanting “I want to heal” or “I want to grow,” then these cards could be interpreted as saying that it is important not to hold things hidden. Because then you can look away from the other person. And then you see more that the Fjord means that you are holding things hidden. You have many hidden intentions that are driving you, that you are not aware of. And that are creating problems. And that the most important thing you can do is to dare to bring that material up and dive deep into yourself.

And then you can say that the Seaweed card can represent the immediate discomfort of stepping outside your comfort zone. Say that you want to take a swim, but you let yourself be stopped because of the seaweed. And you must step on the seaweed. And then the solution may be that you simply start to swim. And then the problem is solved. So it does not need to be such a big problem.

And Bird Cry can in that context represent small comments you give to yourself. The inner scare. The inner stab. The patterns that come up to keep you in place. To keep you from moving outside the comfort zone.

So then I would say that you should do everything you don’t dare to do. You should say yes to what you don’t think you can. You should dare to do things completely opposite from what you have done before. That will bring good results. And it is also meant that you should take that path. Because it is close to what is your soul’s task and your soul’s path. So it is about being intensely present. And it is about being alive, daring to be creative, and taking part in your life.
