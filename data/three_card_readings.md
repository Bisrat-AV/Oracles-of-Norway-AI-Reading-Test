## Nordic Oracle, The Sailor, The Sand
Here we are talking about a person who is incredibly steadfast and whole. An expression that points to a person you can trust. A person who is very capable and kind, very protective. Independent in every way. A person who will sacrifice enormously for their family or for their friends. Very protective. A person who works, stands strong, is typically a provider. A person who will give up everything for their dear and loved ones. And who truly will never disappoint or fail.
We also see that this is a person who is an adventurer. Likes to visit new places, likes to do new things. All based on what the person is asking. If this is an “I want to heal,” then it must be read as someone who takes a lot of responsibility. They gladly take too much responsibility, they are a provider and have suppressed many of their feelings. Maybe that is why they are afraid of doing new things. It is very important to get hold of deep feelings. Be good to oneself. Recommend doing new things. Not be afraid of making mistakes. Not be afraid to open up that you have been there for other people. Not always being the one who has to take all responsibility. But that one can actually release some of that responsibility and receive some care and attention oneself. That is a very important thread.
And also the ability to do new things. To be able to go to work without having control over everything. To take a day off from work. To have your own time. To enjoy yourself at the beach or go for a walk in the forest. Simply do something you may never have done before. That can increase the flow of feminine or creative power in the person.
If, for example, the person asks “I want to be inspired,” then you can say that these cards can be interpreted as the person having everything it takes to dare to make choices and do new things. And that there is nothing to hold back. And if one is to give advice for “I want to be inspired,” then of course one should inspire the person. And then I would say that it is about daring to try and daring to make mistakes. And to see impressions as valuable at the same time. So one does not become too concerned that things will get worse further down the road. Because there is something about how everything balances out in the end. And that it is important to be able to leave many impressions. Go many places, do many things. And that life is a gigantic journey and experience. And that there is nothing to wait for. So those impressions can begin today. Simply by doing things a little differently. And entering into that slightly feminine creative energy. It is like … it is just so good.

## Forest Mist, Midnight Sun, Pathfinder
Here I would say that these three cards – you can say the first one points to complete confusion, the second one points to full illumination and sun, and the last one is about choices. So it is like something a person is standing in – the choices one has to make. It can be about things repeating themselves, and that one becomes confused because one does not understand how old lessons are repeating, and how life is repeatedly difficult.

It depends a little on whether someone is asking about something specific. But I would say that here there is no doubt that solutions are coming, and no doubt that everything will resolve, and that the sun is shining behind the clouds, and that it will soon shine through, so that things will work out well. But there are some lessons here that tell us that this Forest Mist will come as long as the lesson has not been learned. As long as one has not understood the learning, and continues to repeat the old mistakes, then the Forest Mist will come and lay itself over the beautiful sun. So it is a very simple and clear message: Do not deny your lessons, do not go into battle against your challenges, but integrate and take in the learning.
If the person says that they wish to heal, then it will point to the importance of understanding that nothing is being done against you, but rather it is being done for you. The challenges that come in life are there because improvement is needed, an upgrade, or something connected to healing. It could be an old childhood trauma, it could be self-sabotaging patterns, it could be anything – but it is something where one needs to look the truth in the eyes and be able to start choosing differently. And of course, it is also about releasing energy that one is holding on to, which is only a burden. And daring to make important choices, even if at times they are unpopular choices.
So if the person feels very stuck at the moment, then it is not exactly easy to see the way forward. But then again, the sun is coming, so simply do not exaggerate the stuckness, but wait until it passes, and be a little in flow and surrender to your life process.
If it is such that the person wishes to be inspired, then I would say that there are very many choices to choose between. And again, there is a mist here, so some of the choices that are actually there may be hidden. There are many choices you do not see, so you need to wait a little, and look a bit closer, and let time mature the choices, so that you can make good decisions. So I would say: do not give up, because things are not clarified yet, and it is just about continuing forward, and not overdoing anything. Be enduring and patient, because the mist will eventually lift, and then you will see very clearly what you are supposed to do.

## The Seasons, The Country Store, Musical Charge
So here are three cards: The Seasons, The Country Store, and Musical Charge.
The Country Store is a card that means that something can be fixed quite quickly, or that it is nearby. The solution lies quite close. Maybe there is someone who can help you, who lives in the neighborhood, for example. Or you can go and get what you need in the town where you live, and it will not be as complicated as you might think. And in general, in all kinds of topics, it represents that it can be solved quite easily.
But when we look at The Seasons, which is really a card that stands a bit for being very influenced by the seasons, the meaning is that it is no use putting on skis if there is no snow outside. So it must be that kind of connection. And it must be that one acts when the time is right. You smile when the heart is warm. You go to the beach in a bikini when it is sunny. For it must match the seasons, it must match when the opportunity is there – then you take off. And that is what you are encouraged to here. That something can fall into place, and the needs are right nearby.
When we then get Musical Charge, which really stands for meditation and frequencies and sound, then it can actually be advice to meditate, or to listen to uplifting mantra songs, or to use music to get out of brooding and stagnation. And that can be a very good point if one feels a bit stuck and unable to take the opportunities when they are there. So it may well be that this is an important message.
But on the other hand, for many it can also be about something related to sound – music, frequencies – or that it can have to do with everything connected to singing bowls or that kind of things. But it is still somewhat person-dependent how you should interpret Musical Charge. But on a general basis, in this reading, it is about seeking meditation and sound as help to get out of brooding and stagnation. And maybe, if you have a problem you cannot solve, then simply putting on some nice music, putting on something that reminds you of good things, can be enough to loosen things up a bit.
