## Alternative route

Be open to a different approach or perspective. The alternative path wants you to revisit something or add a new dimension to matters or situations. It may mean infusing a spiritual perspective into a conflict or opting for a gentler approach. 
              
              This card also signifies expanded perception that enriches life in ways you couldn't have dreamed of. Have you taken the alternative path today? It's the narrow path that offers different experiences and possibilities than the broad road where you know the distances and can anticipate what awaits you. The narrow path opens you up to a creative consciousness that runs parallel to the broad road, where you receive sensory impressions that suddenly allow you to read between the lines and discover life within life. Choosing to travel with an open and wondering perspective, daring to seek out what lies out there, you don't know what the destination is. Guided by an inner impulse, a drive, and an intuitive longing to live with the soul.
              
              The card does not encourage making foolish choices, quick shortcuts that are headless and reckless, but it's an invitation to bring the soul into your everyday routes. Wherever you're heading or whatever you're doing, ask yourself: have I taken the alternative path today? Be alive, awake, and present in your life. The alternative path is to live with the soul.

## Distances

The card advises you to take the next step from where you stand right now, recognizing that there's still a way to go. This step may require effort and energy, more than you initially anticipated. Stay dedicated to the path you've chosen, even if it involves hard work. While you may not have the wind at your back, being consciously present and awake for the journey ahead is a significant advantage.

              Remain open to new discoveries and insights along the way, keeping your focus on what unfolds before you. The key perspective is to value the journey itself as the primary focus. If you're at the foot of a mountain, rather than dreaming of the summit view, focus on each step and stage required to reach the top, perhaps even passing through tunnels on the way. The more you concentrate on the present moment, the greater joy you'll find in covering the distance.
              
              Regarding outcomes, you will reach your destination even if it takes longer than expected. Sometimes this card indicates distance or differences between people. Focus on personal growth before blaming or judging others. Meeting halfway holds good potential for resolution and understanding.

## Gossiping

They speak negatively and seek to stigmatize others as a distraction from their own insecurities. Drawing this card suggests you may encounter such behavior or witness gossip.
              
              It may also refer to bad friendships, general gossip or dysfunctional groups. The card sometimes serves as a warning against negative speech and dwelling on others' flaws. Instead, focus on positivity and avoid succumbing to pessimism or guilt.

              Maintain a sense of security and stability at home, which will keep you grounded and composed in challenging circumstances.

## The brown field

You're currently on the wrong path. If you're contemplating a choice or specific relationships, this card suggests that the opportunities in front of you are not favorable. It's advised to leave behind the stagnant environment symbolized by the brown field and seek out more promising terrain elsewhere. The current setting may be toxic, characterized by negative thoughts and group dynamics that hinder your growth and progress. Here, you are not being supported, and it is an unsuitable environment for you to be in. 
              
              Consider reassessing your situation and making necessary changes to cultivate more fruitful outcomes in your life. You deserve positive support and to surround yourself with uplifting energy and people who empower you. By following your heart and rejecting toxic environments rather than adapting to them, you can attract the positive experiences you deserve.
              
              Furthermore, this card may signify narcissism and the consequences of destructive relationships in your personal life, family, or work. It's essential to prioritize your well-being and protect yourself from mindsets and individuals that drain your energy and hinder your growth.

              This card signifies changes and experiences akin to riding a roller coaster, moving from one step to the next.

## Waves in the sea

The card represents social gatherings, groups, and networks where influences have an impact on the community and leave imprints. Each person and element contributes to a vibration that creates a curvature, wave, or tide based on their charge and position. The card highlights the influence people wield within a group and confirms that you are affected by what others think of you. However, like waves in the sea, others' choices and their vibrations are transient and short-lived unless you choose to repeat or hold onto this energy.
              
              This is a warning not to overly respond to certain people's energy, which can prolong the initial wave. Acknowledge and note others' impact on you, but be cautious not to validate what is not meant to last. Don't make others' waves a part of your reservoir.
              
              Avoid perpetuating others' waves by placing them on a pedestal. Trust that you are equal, and focus on engaging with your own waters. Your own resonance is closer and more beneficial. Waves come and go. You gain from letting go and surrender to live uninhibited and unaffected by others' motives or intentions. You are not beholden to them.

              If the blue house symbolizes your own home, the card confirms it as a good place for recuperation and contentment.

## The isolated mind

Melancholy and immobility surround you. You may find yourself enveloped in isolation with little light and air to nourish positive thoughts, leading to a sense of confinement. This card suggests clinging stubbornly to old, suffocating thought patterns, fixating on negativity, and projecting unwanted feelings onto others as a distraction from facing personal truths.
              
              The isolated mind symbolizes a closed-off mindset that fears exposure and resists acknowledging reality. This refusal to confront inner truths can perpetuate pain and hinder personal growth and may result in repeated poor choices and self-sabotage. The card urges you to break free from this stagnation and release yourself from the shadows of negative karma that obscure your potential. Whether the isolated mindset is rooted in specific attitudes or represents a fundamental approach to life, the message remains unchanged: Break free from toxic isolation and take a walk in the woods.

              Remember, reaching the mountaintop by helicopter would deprive you of the growth and satisfaction that come from overcoming obstacles.

## Fjord

When the Fjord card appears, it signals that secrets are being kept and important information is not readily available. The energy depicted here is subconscious and influential, presenting as uncertain, questionable, or ambiguous.  Fjord represents uncertain territory, suggesting venturing into unknown realms or dealing with unfamiliar individuals whose intentions remain unclear. This can evoke feelings of nervousness, ambiguity, and insecurity.
              
              This card may also point to unconscious processes where automated thought patterns influence you without clear awareness in the light of day.
              
              The card neither confirms nor denies your query. Conditions are unsettled, and outcomes could swing in different directions. Depending on other choices and your perspective, the situation may unfold differently. Consider your vantage point: are you at a height overlooking the fjord, or are you at its shore or base? Are you swimming in the fjord, or is your head underwater? Grounding yourself in reality and deeper introspection may lead to decisions that shift your circumstances. This card underscores uncertainty and hints at concealed or deliberately hidden matters.

## Escape room

The escaperoom card signifies the importance of protecting yourself from external influences, which is crucial for your well-being right now. This card emphasizes the need for withdrawal, not as a means of avoiding responsibilities, but as a valuable opportunity for rest and self-shielding.  You are encouraged to draw the curtain in front of the window and take a break within your own energy for a while. This retreat is particularly beneficial if you have been experiencing fear or prolonged strain due to relationships or interactions that drain your energy. Sometimes, individuals in positions of power may have undue access to you, making it challenging to sort through your emotions and distinguish between real concerns and imagined fears. In such instances, finding a escape room within yourself can be supportive. This safe space allows you to shield yourself from immediate influences and settle within, reducing reactivity and potential misunderstandings. By avoiding unnecessary waves and chaos, you can navigate interactions more authentically.
              
              This card also suggests a general need to shield yourself from negative news in the public during this vulnerable time.

## Frost on trees

Experiencing this coldness and lack of understanding can be painful, but it's important not to take it personally. You are not being met here for an important reason: the Universe is protecting you, ensuring better times will come.
              
              The card advises you to maintain stamina, strength, and endurance. Avoid seeking easy solutions or compromising yourself to gain approval or security. It's crucial not to give away your power trying to win over those who don't value you or aren't meant for you. Understand that you cannot find love, understanding, or assistance where they do not exist. Instead, connect with the Universe through prayer and embrace your spiritual journey.

## Bird Kingdom

The card portrays an environment where you might feel like the only awakened bird amidst others who hold unhealthy beliefs or concepts. It suggests that the groups you are part of may be influenced by invisible patterns that perpetuate injustice or disappointment. These patterns could stem from family cultures, alliances, or collective dynamics.
              
              Another key message of this card warns against the temptation to use positions within group dynamics for personal gain. For instance, some individuals consistently enjoy social advantages at the expense of others. If someone habitually projects negative traits onto specific types of people and derives personal satisfaction from such actions, it comes with a cost. The "Bird Colony" card illuminates the unconscious tendency to perpetuate these patterns for personal comfort and distraction, even among those striving for spiritual growth and positive values. This investment in projection can lead to justifying questionable choices and exaggerating one's importance.
              
              The card challenges you to abandon projection and see all individuals neutrally and equally. Failing to do so might turn spirituality into a mere concept that conceals potential and obstructs genuine inner progress. It urges accountability if you are benefiting from power and comfort at the expense of others, emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct and genuine spiritual development.

---

## Bird cacophony

This card symbolizes various forms of resistance and disagreement aimed at challenging the choices you are making. It may involve encountering propaganda, scare tactics, or loud opposition from individuals who feel threatened by your opinions or actions. The bird calls represent imposed adversity, where someone is attempting to impede your freedom or disrupt your path of growth. The alarm being sounded is not a genuine threat that requires action on your part; rather, it is intended to unsettle you or drain your energy. This opposition often arises from individuals who are uncomfortable with change or feel they are losing control or influence. They may wish to maintain an unhealthy dynamic or energy exchange that you have chosen to break free from through responsible choices and personal growth.
              
              While this card does not indicate that negative events will occur, it advises you to disregard attempts to instill fear or doubt. People may withdraw goodwill or become difficult to interact with, but recognizing their motives can empower you to stand firm and confident in yourself. You have the right to pursue your own path without fear of others' reactions or attempts to disrupt your progress.
              
              In some cases, the bird calls can also symbolize noise, disagreement, or conflicts arising from differing perspectives and opinions.

## Glassy stare

This card symbolizes a force of indifference and advises you not to invest your time and energy into certain endeavors. Whether it pertains to a job, a relationship, or another pursuit, the card signals a clear "no" and suggests that continuing would likely be futile and frustrating. You may feel misunderstood or judged unfairly, with others projecting negative traits onto you that are actually reflections of their own insecurities. This situation is unlikely to foster a dynamic or flexible interaction; instead, it may feel constricting and lead to anxiety and unrest. It's advisable to steer clear.
              
              Sometimes, this card indicates encountering a person, belief system, or group that appears appealing on the surface but lacks genuine emotional depth or substance. It warns against being deceived by appearances and advises against investing in something that ultimately lacks credibility and value.
              
              If this card reflects qualities within yourself, it suggests a tendency towards passivity at the moment. It's important to take proactive steps and make efforts to move things forward rather than remaining inactive.

## Sparkle in the eye

This is a reminder not to take everything too seriously and to avoid judging others based solely on your personal perspective. It encourages you to let go of the need to keep score of life's events and challenges. If you've been feeling disappointed or have encountered resistance or injustice, this card suggests adopting a more relaxed and nonchalant attitude. Keep a spark in your eye, regardless. Approach everyday-life with a sense of playfulness and curiosity. See life's dance in vibrant colors, and dynamic energies. Observe the antics of those who may try to push you aside or treat you unjustly. Surround everything with a generous and rosy cloud of almost childlike acceptance, akin to a trusting child who sees wonder in everything and believes that bort love and money grows on trees. This perspective offers an irresistible advantage. By embracing this approach, you can avoid dwelling on negative input and prevent it from sinking into your mental "hard drive" and clouding your days with lingering sadness for extended periods.
              
              Choosing to maintain this positive and carefree outlook can lead to unexpected gains and breakthroughs. The universe recognizes and responds to your energy and attitude. By radiating cheerfulness and openness, you may attract favorable outcomes and opportunities that exceed your expectations.
              
              Remember, the universe perceives you from all angles. Welcome a light-hearted and generous spirit, and you may find that life responds in kind, bringing forth positive transformations and enriching experiences.

There is still work to be done. If you seek answers, you'll need to dig a little deeper to uncover them. This card suggests that the answer isn't readily apparent at first glance, but with some effort and investigation, you'll unearth the solution. You don't necessarily need to dig all the way to China, but investing time and energy will lead you to the heart of the matter. Along the way, you may make new discoveries and find treasures that set you on a more fortunate path of thought. Here, you can discover solutions that surpass your initial expectations.
              
              This card also represents inner self-development and the meticulous work required to address emotions and suppressed energy. It may be time to clear out the deepest corners of your psyche. Heavy energies can remain hidden in places you hadn't noticed, buried deep within for years. Releasing this energy can bring significant relief and support to you. Long-standing issues with loose ends can finally be resolved. You'll reconnect with more of your own story and important aspects of yourself that deserve attention. Once accessible, many positive things will follow like pearls on a string: newfound happiness, joy, and blessings.

## Mirroring

This message refers to a person who tends to project their own shortcomings, flaws, and suppressed emotions onto others. It suggests a dynamic where someone relies on seeing and reflecting on others' shadows and faults in order to function in daily life, maintain a sense of balance, and keep their own emotions in check.
              
              The card also signifies a willingness to disregard one's own intuition and inner judgment, holding onto this projection to sustain an artificial balance. This defense mechanism not only affects other people but also perpetuates one's own insecurity and discomfort, hindering necessary personal growth.
              
              In essence, this card serves as a warning against projection and urges you to turn inward to examine your own issues with humility and introspection. It encourages taking responsibility for working with your shadow material — those suppressed feelings, impulses, needs, and secrets that must be acknowledged and integrated over time.
              
              Alternatively, the card may suggest that you are the target of others' projections, but the primary message is to recognize and address the tendency to project onto others to support and reinforce your own self-image. It's important to be mindful of this dynamic and work towards greater self-awareness and authenticity.

These influences could extend beyond the physical realm and involve spiritual or astral energies, imprints, or remnants of past individuals affecting you and draining your energy. It might also involve invasive energies from dominating individuals seeking to control others.
              
              The advice accompanying this card is to avoid responding with fear, anger, or resistance. Instead, focus on healing these emotions within yourself. Your response to these influences can either exacerbate the situation or alleviate it. Work on strengthening your inner power and raising your vibrations by connecting with the light and love within you. Acknowledge your own energy and affirm your personal power to regain control over your life. Additionally, learn how to set external barriers and protect yourself, such as using amulets or symbols like a cross.
              
              Drawing this card may indicate that you are sensitive and possess a powerful inner light that attracts envy or unrest from others.

## The seasons

This card signifies shifts in energy patterns within or around you that will impact your thoughts and feelings. The key advice is to go with the flow and avoid taking anything personally. Life's fluctuations resemble an up-and-down spiral, moving from light to heavy, dark to light, much like the changing seasons. During harmonious alignments of energy, represented by this card, you'll experience favorable conditions akin to nature's happy mode - soft grass, pleasant temperatures, gentle breezes, and warming sunshine. When everything around you is aligned positively, you'll find it easier to thrive and navigate challenges.
              
              During these periods of advantageous alignment, you'll notice increased resilience, which make it easier to take risks and handle setbacks. It's an ideal time to embark on new projects or pursuits, with greater energy and enthusiasm to propel you forward. If you've been contemplating climbing a metaphorical mountain, this is the perfect time to begin.
              
              Remember that both external and internal environments are subject to change. Therefore, it's important to seize opportunities during these favorable periods when you're feeling tuned in and capable. However, when these conditions inevitably shifts, bringing harsher weather and stronger winds, it is important to refrain from creating unnecessary worries or problems. Adaptability is key — embrace life's sensory experiences, expecting fluctuations and being conscious and resourceful. Even during storms that stir up earth and dust, opportunities may arise to uncover hidden treasures. Remain active and engaged, regardless of the weather or circumstances. You are encoraged to welcome life's variability and to stay adaptable, as you can discover unexpected riches amidst challenges. Keep moving forward with awareness and openness, ready to navigate life's changing tides and make the most of every moment.

# Deck: roundedOraclesArr

## Ananda

Look inward for the answers you seek; wisdom resides within you. Approach your challenges with a spiritual perspective. If you find yourself in conflict or grappling with uncomfortable emotions or confusing thoughts, elevate your perspective before taking action. Many challenges can be resolved by inviting a higher, loving perspective to counter chaotic thoughts. Open yourself to the powerful vibrations of Ananda, as this will provide the best solutions for you and everyone involved. Consider meditating and practicing breathing exercises to gather energy and gain clarity.

               The high vibration of unity, union, and pure love is encapsulated in the word "Ananda." You can bring this vibration into your life by meditating on the word and speaking it aloud. Express devotion through Ananda. Purify yourself from lower frequencies and negative thoughts by consciously using this sacred word. Repeat it aloud throughout the day and observe its effects on your body. Write it down, internalize it, and remind yourself of it frequently. The power of Ananda resides within you at all times; when tapped into, the word may flow spontaneously from your mouth.

               This is a form of communication between you and the Universe. Strengthen this connection and awaken deep spiritual truths within yourself.

## The Teddy Bear

The teddy bear symbolizes the kind of people you need in your life. This card can indicate that such individuals are on their way to you, or that you are blessed with good and trustworthy friends.

               The teddy bear is gentle and harmless. You can hold it close without fear of pain or betrayal; it is soft and comforting, providing a sense of security. Use it as a metaphor for healthy individuals and environments that possess the qualities you long for, which may have been lacking in your daily life. This card may also suggest that you need a "teddy bear hug" right now—you might require rest and care from others. Perhaps there's an extra need for deep breaths and nurturing. Allow yourself this phase and feel how healing it is when your needs are recognized and met by yourself or someone else.
               
               As an exercise, consider acquiring a teddy bear with a strong "teddy bear effect" to remind your body of good relationships and healthy choices. Notice how it feels when you have secure individuals nearby. This can also help you identify the opposite—situations, environments, or people that cause pain or unrest.
               
               Alternatively, this card can imply that others need your care, or that you can embody "teddy bear qualities" toward people or situations you encounter. Maybe someone needs a hug or your care for a while. This could refer to situations, especially involving children, that should be handled gently. Avoid placing excessive demands or pressure on others. If you're collaborating or negotiating with someone, show generosity and kindness, and avoid suspicion or undue pressure. You'll benefit from adopting this approach.

## Banana

Now is the perfect time to take a chance and seize an opportunity. This card tells you that you are ready for something significant. Trust in the abilities and knowledge you have acquired. The current circumstances may be favorable for handling situations or tasks skillfully. You also have clear boundaries and can enforce them without being excessive or negative. This is important for how others perceive and respond to you. If you are facing a challenge, it's crucial not to doubt or wait too long to get started, as hesitation can make you less clear and sharp. Think of the banana analogy: like a ripe banana that has a soft and flavorful inside with a harder peel, if not eaten at the right time, it becomes tough and loses its appeal. Delaying or hesitating can cause you to miss opportunities.

               At the same time, this card encourages you to check in with yourself and feel connected and ignited. Sense your energy and strong boundaries, remaining flexible yet protected, just like a delicious and ready-to-eat banana. Don't force anything until you feel the right energy.
               
               The banana also serves as a metaphor for dealing with triggers and manipulation techniques. If you are in relationships where you face constant challenges or hurtful projections, think of the banana. Wait for the right time when you are mature and ready before responding. Avoid pushing or impatience. Trust your intuition and approach situations directly, gently, and flexibly without compromising yourself. This means refraining from being provoked and reacting with irritation, avoidance, or other draining methods.
               
               Counter-message: Avoid placing excessive demands on others. Remain flexible.

## Childhood

The card indicates healing and progress on your journey. You will notice a clearer perception and a light emanating from your spiritual self, potentially leading to a new and long-awaited sense of joy. This positive transformation may inspire a deeper connection with nature, sparking a desire to spend more time outdoors. Such positive changes often result from inner work and self-care.

             Additionally, the card suggests that solutions and relief can be found by working with your inner child. If you are grappling with repetitive thought patterns and painful emotions, the card invites you to explore your childhood. Your childhood experiences hold your stories and beliefs, which can still influence you as an adult. Dive into this inner world and observe how your inner child feels and behaves. What expressions does it wear? The card encourages you to create a nurturing environment for your inner child—to lower the volume on harsh voices, erase shadows and rigid lines, paint the walls with pretty colors, and open windows to let in fresh air. Lift the child onto your lap and speak truths of beauty and goodness into its world. Shower the child with light and healing, brightening its inner landscape like a delightful summer day.

             As you engage in this inner work, your inner child will provide you with building blocks to shape your everyday life. Genuine thoughts and pure senses will emerge, allowing you to perceive reality more clearly. Ultimately, your inner child will infuse your adult life with magic, harmony, and joy.

## Boxing ring

This card may indicate potential conflicts or disagreements, ranging from small to more significant issues. Both parties involved might feel a lot is at stake due to personal egos, with others watching as spectators. You might feel compelled to win at all costs, fearing unfavorable consequences of losing, or you might be reacting from suppressed emotions.

               The card advises you to center yourself in your sensitive heart and remember that you cannot lose anything of true value. You are not in a fight or conflict with anyone unless you choose to engage. You have the power to step out of the arena at any time. Try not to take things personally; redirect your focus inward toward your inner center, allowing that feeling to take precedence.
               
               By investing heart energy into the situation, you can transcend the conflict. The other person may continue to engage, but without an opponent, they will confront their own energy. You can also shift the dynamic by emphasizing common ground and shared values. Use humor to inject movement into a stagnant situation. For instance, you might suggest, "Shall we take a stroll up this mountain together?"
               
               If you find yourself caught in self-criticism, apply the same approach to yourself: "Shall I stop beating myself up the mountain?"
               
               Alternatively, this card could be urging you to recognize and leave any situation where you feel subjected to mistreatment. If you often feel trapped in a metaphorical boxing ring, enduring psychological devaluation or constant criticism, it's time to step away. You may be caught in a role that masks your true abilities and worth. Take steps to discover your potential and set higher standards for yourself. Strengthening your boundaries can bring swift rewards, aligning you with the support of the universe and opening doors to unexpected blessings.
               
               Enhance receptivity by taking a soothing swim or a walk in the forest.

## Prayer

This card affirms that your prayers have been heard. Someone is attuned to your deepest longings and needs. Despite current circumstances, things are aligning in your favor, and everything will be alright. It serves as a loving reminder that you are not alone in this life; the universe cares for you deeply and desires the best for you, working behind the scenes for your highest potential to unfold.

 Moreover, this card encourages you to incorporate prayer consciously into your daily life, engaging in heartfelt conversations with the Universe. Approach prayer with devotion and trust, affirming your needs and desires sincerely:
 
               "Dear Universe, bless me and guide me. Create a safe, warm, and fulfilling space for me."
 
 
 These simple words invite support, clarity, and light into your life, challenging the belief that you are undeserving of love, success, or deep, meaningful experiences. You possess the same inherent worth and rights as every other person.
 
 Through prayer, observe how the Universe responds. Allow these words to resonate within your body and thoughts, making you receptive to the dormant gifts and light within you. Embrace the truth about yourself—you are a sensitive soul with profound spiritual wisdom to share. You are loved, valuable, and irreplaceable. Express yourself through prayer regularly to acknowledge your deepest longings and needs.

## energy vampire

This card brings awareness to the presence of energy-draining individuals in your life. These may be people who consistently disregard your agreements and time, offering excuses and avoiding responsibilities. They could also exhibit negative thoughts, habits, or behaviors that emit toxic energy. They might attempt to compensate for this by engaging in verbose and oppressive conversations or behaviors that swiftly deplete your emotional and mental energy. Remember, your time and attention on Earth are precious, and while kindness and patience are admirable qualities, it's unhealthy to enable others' self-deception at the expense of your own well-being. Such interactions can leave you drained and lacking the energy to care for yourself. Stay vigilant and establish clear boundaries. Trust your body's signals to conclude conversations or limit contact in such situations.

This card may also signify individuals who trigger anxiety, worry, and feelings of inferiority, weakening your inner balance and center. These "energy vampires" could manifest within group dynamics, family cultures, or physical environments that feel suffocating. If you constantly find yourself depleted of energy due to external influences rather than internal processes, take proactive steps to set boundaries. Consider distancing yourself from relevant places or individuals and seek activities that foster light and positive energy. Pay attention to interactions that nurture increased vitality and self-esteem versus those that evoke stress and anxiety.

Alternatively, this card could reflect your own thoughts that constrict joy in life. Perhaps you're exerting excessive force or striving for outcomes without aligning with your energy state. It's crucial to seek balance and ensure you're in tune with yourself before moving forward. Take your time and refrain from investing energy in endeavors that don't resonate positively.

Energy loss can also result from unwise time management, engaging in activities that deplete rather than replenish you. Consider your intentions behind how you allocate your time. For some, this card may highlight financial mismanagement, emphasizing the importance of pausing, taking a deep breath, and gaining perspective. Remember, abundant energy and resources are available when you align with your natural source. Pursue activities that bring joy, uncovering untapped reservoirs of vitality.

## The Fall

Someone is losing their influence over you. They see you slipping away, which may cause a breakdown in their energy and confidence. This card symbolizes the supportive process of shedding group dynamics. It could signify the dissolution of relationships or groups you were once part of. For some, it relates to karmic relationships where you were unfairly treated or not given equal standing, and now balance will be restored. The fall indicates that a revelation is unfolding in your favor, and others may experience defeat. If someone has taken credit for your work or attempted to discredit you, they will not succeed. This card halts all forms of manipulation and energy attacks.

This card confirms that the fall is a necessary phase of change where karma ultimately brings light and truth to situations and relationships. It may create opportunities for reconciliation and forgiveness, fostering healthy perspectives. However, individuals confronted with long-held deceptions may resist enlightenment. Be cautious not to let guilt influence you into making poor choices or allowing past pain and abuse back into your life.

Alternatively, this card signifies the dispelling of illusions. If you've been oblivious to a situation, a wake-up call may be necessary to prompt better choices. Ultimately, a revelation concerning yourself will lead to positive transformation. Embrace introspection, meditate on your history and shadow sides, and integrate any resistance or shame. Cultivate deep self-acceptance and love for all aspects of yourself. The energy that emerges afterward is akin to the dawn of spring, heralding renewal and growth.

## The flame

Healing is on the way! This is a time of relief and spiritual support. The flame depicted in this card offers a range of beautiful tools that can dissolve challenging situations and conflicting thoughts. Allow the flame to work its magic, and observe as thought and energy fields soften. Feel receptive and comfortable as the flame brings you relief and deep relaxation.

         The flame symbolizes the spiritual light burning within you, which can take on any color you desire. Use these colors consciously to heal painful emotions or to liberate yourself from situations and relationships you wish to distance yourself from. Visualize the flame filling your entire body and extending into every corner. Ask the flame for protection, and witness it growing and radiating outward in a grand arc. You can also ask the flame to enlighten you with clear thoughts and understanding, or to inspire your creativity. Each time you acknowledge this inner flame, it revitalizes your motivation to make choices aligned with your true self. You merge with your spiritual light, drawing kindred spirits towards you, as others intuitively recognize your authentic essence. This natural magnetism allows you to attract those who resonate with your journey, potentially leading to creative collaborations or partnerships that enrich your life.

         The flame is also a powerful tool for radiating light and warmth into the world, capable of healing individuals, circumstances, and environments. When harnessed actively, its effects are observable and appreciated. As you generously share your authentic gifts and wisdom, your flame can glow as a brilliant white light independently. Your journey and experiences can inspire others to embrace and nurture their own inner flames.

You'll find more space to maneuver, radiating more light, and allowing your beautiful soul to become visible. Together, these elements can ignite a brilliant fireworks display, where the universe joyfully celebrates with you.

## Poison

This card indicates the presence of toxic energy directed toward you, whether in the form of negative intentions, envy from others, or critical thoughts about you that you might sense. However, rather than being a cause for fear, this card suggests that such toxic energy could actually be a sign of your growing vitality and inner strength, as well as a discovery of your inherent worth. You may be on the brink of rising and creating a better life for yourself, which can trigger individuals in your circle who resist seeing you in a new light. It might involve someone who previously projected their own weaknesses and flaws onto you, realizing now that this projection no longer holds.

 Though these energies may feel uncomfortable and create fear, you can protect yourself by focusing on your own insights and understanding the underlying intentions behind others' actions. When you recognize what drives them, you can more easily retain your power and not succumb to fear. Take this card as confirmation that you have nothing to fear.
 
 Consider training yourself on coping strategies for dealing with such energies. If toxic energy manifests as physical discomfort or pain, use methods to swiftly release it from your body. Purify yourself by visualizing radiant light and healing flames filling your body, and amplify the effect with your favorite color. Consume plenty of lemon water or herbal tea. Other methods include using mirrors to deflect the energy away from you or invoking universal light to absorb it. Another approach involves mentally shrinking the individuals projecting these energies, causing the energy itself to decrease proportionately, making it more manageable.
 
 For overall protection, wear pendants and crystals, absorb prana from nature, and work to keep your energy frequencies high. Be particularly mindful in situations involving people or circumstances with negative past experiences. Over time, the frequencies of love in your sensitive soul will naturally protect you, causing toxic energies to dissolve as your inner light grows stronger.

 Alternative meaning: This card can also signify when you find yourself thinking negatively about someone or wishing ill upon them. Perhaps you are tempted to speak ill of others despite knowing it goes against your better judgment. The card warns against creating greater imbalance and advises focusing on your inner center and heart's feelings to shift away from this negative energy. Work to raise your frequencies and regain inner balance.

---

## Blister

The card advises against seeking love and understanding where it doesn't exist and subjecting yourself to repeated painful rejections. This may involve interactions with people who constrain you and refuse to acknowledge your words and contributions. Avoid falling into the trap of confronting such individuals or pouring out your heart, as it will only leave a bitter taste in your mouth.

 Consider reevaluating friendships or partnerships that feel like festering sores, where conflicts and negative energy persist endlessly. A sensitive soul like yours might linger in unhealthy relationships for too long, taking on the responsibility for healing or fixing situations that are not viable. Trust your intuition and the lessons life offers, and make wise choices. Avoid allowing situations to develop into festering wounds. Refrain from resurrecting a partner or relationship out of guilt or through rose-colored glasses. Think of uncomfortable shoes that eventually cause blisters; it's best to leave them behind. Stop explaining and defending yourself to people who don't make room for your energy and leave you with a painful feeling and aftertaste.
 
 The primary message of this card is to avoid repeating past mistakes. Use your delicate sensitivity to make necessary and wise decisions.

 Following this advice can significantly impact your life situation, applying to habits, actions, and mindsets that no longer serve you and are ready to be replaced. The shoe in this card may also symbolize an unfortunate role you identify with, which creates pain and wounds. As long as you remain in this role and nurture harmful thoughts about yourself, things will not change. This shoe will never fit your foot or be a good match. The wound cannot heal as long as you continue to step into shoes that are too tight. Even if you put on a bandage for a while, it offers only temporary relief. This card asks you to set aside the shoe and let the blister heal without the tight and constricting feeling. You will soon discover shoes that fit perfectly for you. Walk barefoot for a while!

---

## Group dynamics

This card points to unhealthy group and role dynamics, particularly noticeable in individuals and systems that lack personal freedom, aiming to dictate your path and assert control over you. The position you hold or the role you assume significantly impacts how you feel and how others perceive and treat you.

 Reflect on whether you experience the freedom and empowerment to be your authentic self and breathe freely, or if you feel diminished and hindered by invisible barriers. This card sheds light on the realities of group dynamics and inspires you to liberate yourself from patterns that confine you to a lesser life situation.
 
 As long as you identify with an adopted role in an unhealthy group dynamic, you work against your own flourishing and progress. Avoid nurturing and supporting such a role by confirming and investing in thoughts and actions that strengthen it. Understand that the role is driven by unconscious processes and illusions imprinted on you from birth. The unconscious consists of thoughts, emotions, and beliefs that you do not have immediate access to, but you can learn to recognize through wise inner work. Give yourself the freedom to explore your shadow sides, as it can help you penetrate defense mechanisms and inner shame. Sit in peace with yourself and notice the power of owning your story and experiences held within your energetic body. Work on deep self-acceptance to enter the depths of the subconscious sea and allow waves of healing and release.
 
 This card advises that group dynamics require active participation at all levels, and your role dissolves when you do not affirm or energize it. The greater the unconscious material made conscious, the more you can withdraw your energy from toxic relationships and roles you have played. Set clear boundaries with people who draw power and self-regulation through you and your position. If you've played the role of the scapegoat, the vulnerable one, or the weakest link, there will be a significant void after you that can trigger nervousness, restlessness, and confusion in others. This can activate mechanisms that aim to persuade you to reinvest energy into that role.

 In this deck, you will find cards like "Perpetrator," "Energy thief," and "The juggler," all pieces in the group dynamic that may prevent you from awakening and progressing. They may seek to provoke anger, negativity, or shameful feelings in you that confirm you in the role of the scapegoat. Be brave and strong, embracing all aspects of yourself. Trust in the truth that cards like "The Heart Code" and "Honey Tears" bring to body and mind. Unhealthy group energies are harmful, and you must withdraw your energy. You likely serve as a beacon, here to disseminate fresh perspectives and an entirely new understanding of humanity. Namaste.

## Home relationships

This card symbolizes both your inner and outer home and suggests that the solutions you seek lie within you. Focus on self-improvement to effect the changes you desire; now is not the time to place blame on external factors or people outside your household for difficulties. Concentrate on cultivating positive thoughts and inner growth to strengthen your inner relationships and empower yourself. As you tap into your personal power and take responsibility for solutions, the positive effects will extend beyond your home, opening up new possibilities. Your desires can manifest, and others will perceive you as resilient and proactive.

 Additionally, this card may highlight challenging home relationships where you feel unacknowledged or mistreated. It could point to a negative role within your family dynamic, where other members project their weaknesses onto you and fail to appreciate your strengths and positive qualities. Although home life and community life may appear separate, negative home relationships can influence interactions in society due to underlying group dynamics. This pattern may lead others to feel entitled to mistreat you.
 
 It's crucial to recognize that a strong foundation at home is essential for thriving in other areas of life. Poor home relationships can diminish your magnetic presence and lead to unfulfilling social interactions and friendships. This card encourages you to work on improving or changing your home relationships to secure a better position in life.

 Alternative interpretation: Ensure that your home is a sanctuary where you find peace and rest. Apply Feng Shui principles to arrange your space to support the flow of energy and create balance.

## The Heart Code

The Heart Code is a method where you choose to surrender to your heart, allowing situations and emotions to flow through the heart chakra. Open your heart to choose paths that are not tied to your ego, roles, or personality. Trust that the universe and your higher self hold the best solutions for you, whether in mastering situations and relationships or in healing challenging emotions and thoughts. The Heart Code can liberate you from negative thinking, deep-seated beliefs, and patterns that keep you stuck in old pain. It can provide you with the answers you need when you are confused or extend solace when you find yourself amidst chaos and anxiety.

               The Heart Code serves as a form of password or key that unlocks the door to your heart, granting you access to this potent energy. You'll experience an immediate sense of confidence in possessing the necessary tools.This is your personal code. To find it, explore what enables you to let go and take the chance, recognizing that guidance and relief are discovered through surrender. What actions or inactions, thoughts or lack thereof, support your journey? What do you respond well to that gives you the courage you need? Explore and experiment to uncover this code. Sometimes, a simple gesture like placing your hand on your heart and being dedicated is enough.

               Use the Heart Code when you encounter challenging situations and tend to slip into habitual thinking and rationalization. Turn to it when fear stalls you or when you're overwhelmed by uncomfortable emotions. Whenever you seek guidance to navigate your thoughts and perceptions, or when you urgently need to heal intense emotional distress, the Heart Code can be your ally.

               Remember that heart energy operates best when you're not trying to control or foresee the outcome. This energy is only available in the present moment. You must be willing to release your attachment to a specific result and fully embrace the 'here and now' with trust. When you choose this, it will support you and offer the best outcome for the current situation. You can experience a profound sense of confidence and inner strength, receiving the validation that allows for reconciliation and win-win situations. Instead of defending your ego or acting from a personal standpoint, you align with tranquil and harmonious solutions.

               When you act in unconditional trust, primarily in yourself, the heart is enough! Notice how everything falls into place, and you feel relaxed, friendly, and present, regardless of life's circumstances. Embracing the idea of surrendering your role and responsibilities to the heart takes courage. By practising this now, you can gain experience and feel confident enough to jump at new opportunities and chances. Under such conditions, good, warm friendships can flourish.

## Honey Tears

Healing tears infused with love can transform emotions, situations, and mindsets. These tears convert pain into manageable material that you can navigate. This card signals potential healing and a spiritual awakening, inviting you to embrace spiritual energy as a viable path forward. You may encounter opportunities to surrender the ego, trusting in the inner spiritual core of your being. This shift can greatly aid in integrating and processing suppressed emotions and energy, allowing you to release old attachments and progress in life.

  "Honey tears" are liberating tears that bring nourishment and sweetness to the body. They can feel rejuvenating, infusing you with vibrant life and contentment. These tears may arise when you discover hidden talents, newfound facets of yourself, or suddenly recognize your own beauty. They symbolize the shedding of roles within unhealthy group dynamics and offer a sense of renewed dignity. They represent the ultimate release of the false self, aligning with your Higher Self. Honey tears signify an upgrade following awakening and major breakthroughs, leaving you healed and filled with sweet emotions and wisdom.

  These tears are a blessing, offering an opportunity for everyone to relinquish control and despair over life's challenges. They bring relief and solutions by severing ties to lower vibrations that cause pain. Genuine tears cannot be forced or summoned at will; they emerge naturally when painful emotions are consciously released through surrender. Embracing this brave choice rewards you with a warm, delightful, and secure feeling, akin to bathing in honey—a gift from the universe! Om Shanti!

## The Speaker

Pay close attention to the direction of your thoughts and avoid getting caught up in overthinking. If you find yourself focused on flaws and deficiencies, it's time to take a pause. Open yourself to the blessings that destiny has in store for you; be receptive to advice that can soothe and uplift your situation.

  Welcome the vibrations of the sacred Universe to enter and enrich your mind with fresh insights and deeper understanding.

  This card speaks of a magical soundbox that is always available to you. Learn how to listen and unwrap your gifts. The more attuned you become, the greater the likelihood that the soft voice of the Universe will resonate within you. Seek out activities, places, and people capable of amplifying the Universe's resonance. This could be through mantras (like AH or OM), spiritual music, community, meditation, nature, books, or other means. Allow your aura to be bathed in the vibration of the Universe and let your body be filled with divine recognition. Familiarize yourself with how it feels.

## Crash and fall

This card encourages you to adopt a generous attitude towards yourself and embrace the inevitable ups and downs without being deterred by old habits or behaviors from the past. Whether you're repeating past mistakes or falling into familiar patterns right now, see this as a period where the Universe is testing you to uncover areas where you may self-sabotage or operate from unconscious needs and beliefs. It's an opportunity to shine a light on your life illusions, defense mechanisms, and unhelpful thinking and actions. While this self-reflection may feel uncomfortable, be kind to yourself and avoid self-judgment or reinforcing negative thoughts.

   Imagine your life as streams flowing through a forest, following their natural course without choice. Apply this concept to your life—you have the power to introduce the energy for a new path by becoming aware of it. Choose a path aligned with love, forgiveness, healthy boundaries, and positive thinking.

   One practical approach is to adjust your behavior when you catch yourself falling into old patterns. For instance, if you tend to dismiss compliments, practice accepting them and affirm your worthiness. If you feel the urge to downplay achievements or dwell on mistakes, work on receiving recognition graciously. Similarly, if you find yourself over-explaining or overextending in certain situations, remind yourself that you don't owe people anything. It's not your responsibility if something goes wrong or situations don't work out for someone. Learn from the ups and downs to break free from self-sabotage and maintain your balance.

## Corpse

This card symbolizes everything that stifles vitality, flow, and joy—thoughts, abandoned projects, activities, and efforts that simply do not thrive. It warns against relying on sheer willpower to sustain painful relationships or situations. If you find yourself repeatedly using ineffective solutions or trying to digest the indigestible, consider this a wake-up call. "Corpse" reveals the significant obstacles and blockages hindering you from achieving the life you desire.

If your daily life feels persistently burdened by difficulties and shortcomings, it may be a sign of the influence of this card. You might be trapped in mindsets and behaviors that do not align with your true desires and needs.

Additionally, this card can indicate a tendency to shoulder others' pain while neglecting to receive what you deserve in return. You may internalize the judgments and opinions of others, carrying them as lifeless burdens in your belly. Taking things too personally and giving undue weight to external opinions can also be part of this pattern.

In essence, the card advises clearing away remnants of the past and inviting fresh energy into your life. It's beneficial to make time for inner and outer cleansing, decluttering both your projects and your living space. When assessing your belongings, keep only what is beautiful, uplifting, and genuinely useful. Embrace deep emotional processes, accepting and processing past traumas. The card emphasizes that carrying baggage from the past and suppressing emotions can weaken your mental clarity, capacity, and courage.

Practices like meditation, using mantras, incense, and essential oils, spending time in nature, and opting for nourishing foods can enhance receptivity and cooperation of your body. Temporarily avoiding alcohol and sugar can also support this process. Incorporating oracle cards into your routine can provide ongoing support and guidance.

Alternatively, the "corpse" card may signify tasks, thoughts, and activities inadvertently perpetuating an undesirable role within a group dynamic. If you find yourself absorbing negative projections from others and resisting positive experiences, it may indicate the presence of a "corpse" in your belly, weighing you down. Remember, you cannot maintain a healthy digestion while shouldering others' emotions or self-denial.

Lastly, the card may highlight a tendency to absorb others' burdens through your belly rather than your heart, driven by empathy and compassion. While admirable, this approach can deplete your vitality. Others have their own inner strength, and you can support them best by nourishing your own vitality and connecting through the heart, rather than shouldering anxiety and responsibility. Focus on tools like Ananda and the Heart Code for clarity and liberation from excessive burdens.

## Gut feeling

You possess a profound sensitivity—the ultimate sensor. Your intuition is exceptionally strong and clear, communicating with depth and honesty. Through your vibrant and intelligent gut feeling, you receive messages and unmistakable signs, revealing truths about relationships and situations. Your intuition is particularly potent now, so choose to listen inwardly rather than overanalyze or dwell on matters. Avoid seeking advice from others when you already know the answers.
  
                Your gut feeling serves as a bridge to your higher self, bestowed upon you by the universe as a remarkable tool that operates with unwavering accuracy. If negative self-talk or self-doubt creeps in, your gut will signal that you are mistaken. It may manifest as stomach pains or unease, providing a clear message when your thoughts stray from reality. The discomfort also serves as a warning against specific choices or actions that could diminish something important to you.

                Some times your stomach-ache can act as an alarm in the presence of individuals with ill intentions or dishonesty. It may also react when old, unresolved issues resurface, causing anxiety and uncertainty. In these instances, your gut feeling reminds you that you are in a process and need time to digest what has surfaced.

                A calm and relaxed stomach signifies positive conditions and confirms well-being. Pay attention when your stomach allows for free-flowing thoughts and a sense of trust and spaciousness. Have confidence in the wisdom it shares with you. Nurture your stomach with care. Use beneficial oils and shower it with love. It is a precious gem within you, illuminating truths and holding genuine significance!

## Mentor

This card suggests the presence of an important person in your life. It may be a skilled and capable helper, mentor, or contributor who can assist you in projects, situations, or other aspects of your life. Take it as encouragement to accept advice and assistance from others. If you're dealing with unhealthy roles and relationships causing pain, this person may understand what you need and the steps you must take to free yourself. A mentor can inspire you to use your sensitivity and power more effectively and teach you about setting boundaries. Consider exploring new career paths, hobbies, or directions within self-improvement and spiritual growth.

                A mentor has walked the path before you in their respective field and has made important discoveries. They have learned from their own mistakes and possess profound understanding and knowledge. While they may not know your exact path, they can share insights and highlights that you can filter and absorb. A mentor may appear unexpectedly through social media, chance encounters, friends, books, courses, or elsewhere. They can act as a protector, advocate, and advisor, guiding you in the right direction and offering genuine support.

                The card encourages you to delve deeply when seeking a mentor. Many helpers have knowledge but lack the genuine insight and experience you need. Use your intuition to discern who it is safe to open up to. A suitable mentor may have a high vibration, standing apart from masking group dynamics. They could be innovative and different, perhaps even eccentric. If they're the right mentor, you will feel safe and understood. They won't seek validation from group energy or be guided by conventional thinking. They also won`t get threatended by your light and power. Instead, they will intuitively see who you are behind the roles and mask and feel honored and attracted to helping you discover your athentic being. A perfect mentor is free, wise, and vulnerable.

                Alternatively, the card may also signal a new and important role as a guide and mentor for others, prompting you to step into a leadership position. Finally, the card advises you to use your insights wisely and avoid self-sabotage. Be discerning in all that you do.

## Master

You deserve praise and recognition. This card signifies success, favorable contracts, and positive agreements. Things are aligning with your desires, and you are receiving acknowledgment for your skills and hard work. The card may highlight exceptional abilities in a specific field or area.

 It has taken significant effort to cultivate the insight you now possess, granting you freedom and confidence in your own judgment. You can trust the answers you receive when questioning yourself.
 
 Additionally, this card suggests that you have expanded your awareness and attained greater freedom. You may now see through layers of illusion and discern between what's apparent and what lies behind the curtain. Your heightened sensitivity enables you to perceive energies even in everyday conversations about mundane topics like the weather. You can detect life's falsehoods and expose manipulation. Your consistency in seeing through things stems from inner knowing rather than superficial knowledge or chance. This insight has been developed through enduring hardships and challenges, and it remains steadfast even in darkness, providing clarity and perspective.

 For some, this card signifies the ability to perceive group dynamics within society and families, recognizing them in various forms and expressions. You don't rely on specific traits or descriptions but instead sense and read energies intuitively. You are awakening to deeper truths. This card may also indicate that these qualities are emerging within you or that you will encounter someone who inspires you to break free from illusions and heighten your awareness. Finally, it may refer to a skilled and talented partner or a highly developed child in your life. This card suggests positive outcomes overall for what you are asking about.

## Awakening

The alarm clock rings, urging you to awaken and rise from slumber. It's time to see the truth clearly and embrace a life of clarity. Perhaps it's time to ask yourself: Who am I really? This card may herald spiritual insights and heightened intuition that resonate deeply with you. It also signifies the lifting of mental fog, allowing you to open up to profound and genuine insights that can penetrate limited thoughts and attitudes. You may experience moments of sudden clarity and understanding, often when least expected. This newfound awareness can resolve many aspects of your life and reveal a pathway toward budding joy and improved circumstances. It's important to let go of overthinking, analysis, and rumination, as these can delay or hinder this awakening.

                Another interpretation of this card relates to becoming mindful of what has led to disappointments in relationships and friendships. Perhaps you have extended yourself too far for people who do not have your best interests at heart, investing your loyalty and energy in the wrong places. This could involve relationships where others do not view you as an equal or secretly wish for your failure. Placing your valuable attention and trust in the hands of undeserving individuals who may misuse it is a form of self-betrayal. By settling for less, you block genuine intimate experiences and friendships. The awakening card encourages you to unpack your beautiful life by practicing self-respect, irrespective of circumstances. Choose relationships with people who reflect the best in you, genuinely want you to flourish, and support your destiny's unfolding.

## Perpetrator

Perpetrators can refer to individuals or situations that pose a threat to your safety. This warning signals a need for action or awareness of underlying patterns that attract such individuals. Perpetrators may exhibit behaviors such as fault-finding, criticism, misunderstanding, distortion, or attempts to undermine you. Their actions can influence your credibility, trigger doubt and fear, and cause you to hold back. Some individuals may intrude into your space due to perceived weaknesses or vulnerabilities, which unconsciously reinforces their control and superiority.

                As a sensitive person within group dynamics, you may attract perpetrators in various contexts. Some perpetrators seek to control how others perceive you by spreading misinformation or portraying you negatively. Others may isolate you from support networks, leading to a loss of confidence and reluctance to take risks. Being around perpetrators can shut down your social interactions and free expression.

                The card advises you to pay attention to your feelings when limiting thoughts and self-criticism arise. Notice the impact of group energies on you. Identify any invisible abuse within your circle or family where attitudes and perceptions create stress and nervousness. It may also entail a gathering of minds that collectively harbor a negative view of you, so when you are exposed to this group energy, it can profoundly affect you in a negative way..It's crucial to recognize such relationships to protect yourself and break free from harmful dynamics. You are encourage to take firm control of your life. 

                Simultaneously, these experiences provide an opportunity for profound self-discovery and may harbor hidden blessings in disguise. Perpetrators exploit subconscious vulnerabilities and unresolved inner traumas. Do you carry traces in your subconscious of energy leaks and weak boundaries stemming from trauma? Perpetrators seek to bolster themselves by exploiting these perceived weaknesses. Perhaps you've shared many personal problems or negative aspects with them, or you carry your wounds prominently in your energy field. Maybe you tend to undervalue yourself, giving away your personal space. Fear-driven behavior can also make you particularly susceptible to it. Alternatively, you may encounter individuals who use power tactics to provoke fear and target you due to your responsive nature. Succumbing to fear can hinder your ability to assert yourself and embrace your true presence. It's crucial to unlock the potential of your sensitive soul, which grants you an eagle-eye perspective to approach situations like this with insight and distance, and free from fear.

                Perpetrators are often motivated by deep-seated powerlessness and a need for control that seeks validation from group dynamics. Look beyond these influences and strive for clear boundaries and balance. Practice rejecting such individuals with love and self-respect. Remember, you possess a powerful inner light, and there's ample support available through prayer and spiritual guidance. Don't hesitate to seek help from others if you need it. Trust your intuition to discern how this card resonates best with you, and consider drawing more cards for further clarity.

                Counter Message: Avoid letting latent anger or bitterness dictate your behavior. Address pain energy within yourself to convey a more harmonious and humble demeanor. Open up to healing to allow others to embrace your sensitive nature with understanding and compassion. This approach fosters greater harmony and acceptance in your interactions.

You gain the experience of having your needs and desires fulfilled, feeling inherently valuable, secure, and deserving of good things. You come to know that the universe cares for you, and these pearls serve as tangible evidence of life's care.

Find peace in the understanding that what is meant for you cannot be lost. Take comfort in knowing that no one can impede the pearls that belong to you, just as you have no desire to interfere with what belongs to others.

When you first discover a pearl, you may not fully grasp its value. Its true worth may reveal itself as you examine it more closely and carry it with you. Sometimes pearls are hidden, requiring a bit of searching or heightened attention. Notice what stirs longing and passion within you. What qualities do you admire in others? Let these insights guide you toward discovering your own potential. When you find the pearls that are meant for you, your heart will affirm their value with a sparkling joy that fills your chest and wraps you in warmth.

## Pajamas-e

The card suggests that help and support will come from warm and kind-hearted individuals, or through focusing on self-care and empowering thoughts. You need to shield yourself from external impressions and noise. Consider withdrawing from exposure, activities, and groups for a while to find peace within. If you're feeling stressed and internally restless, allow a calm and peaceful perspective to emerge. Avoid confrontations and conflicts. Embrace soothing energies and adopt an attitude that everything is good and well. You might also create a cozy nook at home where you can make the surroundings warm and inviting.

This card encourages you to acquire tools and methods that strengthen your authentic power and help you feel more at home within yourself. It's not just about having one pair of pajamas but several. The key is to evoke a sense of safety and comfort that nurtures and validates you internally. This could involve cherished blankets, a favorite pair of pajamas, meaningful jewelry, a special place, a crystal, a delightful cup of herbal tea, and more. Pajamas serve as a metaphor for the inner state that brings peace, love, and support. The card can also signify that your needs will be met, allowing you to rest assured. You have a comfortable bed, enough food, just the right amount of warmth, and an inner circle where you feel safe. Blessings and pleasant news may come because you are receptive and at peace with your life. If you seek help from someone, you can trust them.

Another interpretation: If you are processing a lot of trauma and grief, releasing and healing may trigger feelings of coldness, chills, and periods of intense inner pain. Use your pajamas to their fullest potential during these moments. If you feel that others cannot provide the support you need, let your pajamas comfort you. Surround yourself with warmth and closeness in your immediate environment, and allow supportive friends to visit when appropriate.

## The Journey

The card encourages you to view the journey as a necessary path to traverse. This journey represents a path out of illusions, pain, and potential negative self-perception. It may also symbolize the sensation of bearing the weight of the world on your shoulders and assuming too much responsibility.
                
                Perhaps you find yourself not living the life you desire and dream of being in a better place. This is a call to dedicate yourself to doing what it takes. Embrace the ability to smile and show compassion along the way. Cultivate patience, curiosity, and a willingness to explore what needs to be left behind and what you should carry forward. The steps you take, the choices you make, and the burdens you release will be worthwhile. With each stage, you reclaim more of yourself. When you step fully into your shoes and let out a heartfelt sigh, then you have arrived.

                The journey may lead you across seas with tumultuous waves, over fragile bridges, or onto shaky planes that spark fear within you. You must summon bravery and stand up for yourself, trusting that life will carry you and that you are capable of filling the shoes that await further ahead. Alternatively, the journey might offer sailing trips across the sea, refreshing swims in a cold mountain lake, or leisurely walks in the forest. Celebrations will punctuate your path as you encounter authentic emotions and sensations that resonate deeply within your chest. You will receive rejuvenation and strength that motivates you to persevere. Over time, your self-confidence and zest for life will grow, igniting sparks in your heart.

                This journey will provide you with diverse experiences. Take note of your progress day by day. Remind yourself why this journey is necessary and that you are moving towards a long-awaited and brighter future. Be honest with yourself and embrace the experiences life offers. Do not let a day pass without acknowledging the important work you are doing.

## Sense of space

This card signifies that you possess the ability to welcome others and encourage them to expand their sense of space. You inspire others to explore and express themselves without overshadowing their energy or imposing your own agenda. These qualities make you an exceptional therapist and friend.

                Additionally, this card can indicate freedom from nervousness and pretense. It's important for you to breathe freely and not fear making mistakes. Being around others should feel safe and comforting. Perhaps you need to invite in lots of fresh air and expand your inner comfort zone. If so, allow yourself to twist your body, open your chest, and make room for what wants to emerge. The current conditions may be favorable for making wonderful discoveries about yoga and the benefits of stretching muscles and joints. You might find that certain people or settings are conducive to exploring boundaries and intimacy in a safe manner. Consider attending workshops or retreats that could meet these needs.

                Become comfortable with listening to your body's language. Feel that it's okay to move freely, turn your head, and say yes or no. You are in control of your life. Also, recognize how good it feels to inhabit your body and explore the delightful sensations and feelings it can bring you. Practice experiencing pleasure without resistance or shame. Lie down on the floor with your arms and legs out to the sides and feel the sensation of existing without exerting any effort. Stamp your heels and draw in supportive earth energy through your feet. Acknowledge the power that carries you through life and that you can rely on. Sensing space also involves expressing yourself through your voice and allowing energies to unfold naturally. Permit yourself to scream, sing, hum, whisper, or enjoy the silence. This card confirms your innate ability to contain yourself.

## Rumi

Insights often arrive after a challenging period or event. Be forgiving towards yourself and seek spiritual guidance and support during this time. These phases will pass, each feeling like a small awakening—a blindfold removed from your eyes or your lungs given more room to breathe. This card promises that light will soon flow through your mind and body, bringing a smile to your face.

               Rumi speaks of the value in painful phases that bring deep transformation and significant life changes. Just as reaching the summit of a high mountain requires effort and endurance, the reward is a blessed breeze and a breathtaking view. Embrace the discomfort of growth and stretching into your potential, knowing that inner satisfaction and clarity await you. Hang in there!

Another aspect of this card is related to the sensitive soul serving as a gateway to spiritual awareness. If you possess a sensitive heart, you might often feel a significant responsibility and encounter instances where others reject or misunderstand the light and insights you offer. This can lead you into a challenging role where you feel compelled to adapt and compromise your own truth. However, a heart like yours has the potential to break free from the constraints that have kept us blind to our true selves. If this description resonates with you, you likely understand the importance of your task and possess a deep intuitive ability to perceive energies. You hold valuable wisdom that you may not openly discuss. Since an early age, you may have experienced inner turmoil and turbulence, leading you to explore spiritual topics ahead of others in your social network.

This card also highlight the role of individuals and groups who become scapegoats for the darker aspects, confusion, and suffering that arise when souls are unable to unfold freely. Some individuals serve as channels for negativity within a community, often being identified with its flaws, weaknesses, and deficiencies. These patterns in group dynamics categorize us into different roles, allowing the majority to project negative qualities and unwanted feelings onto a minority or vulnerable person to alleviate their own discomfort. Seeking compensation for imbalances in our spiritual lives through collective consciousness and group dynamics leads to the need for these projections, representing a hidden form of abuse prevalent in institutions, families, friendships, schools, and any setting where the soul is stifled.

               In certain groups, this effect is intensified and systematized when specific individuals are assigned and adopt fixed roles as scapegoats, identified patients, or the weaker links. The Rumi card speaks directly to those who find themselves in such roles. This could be someone experiencing mental health challenges, substance abuse issues, or feeling trapped in their own home. It could also be someone surrounded by controlling individuals, yet remaining self-effacing and kind. Alternatively, it might be someone with an active lifestyle and large network, burdened by the responsibility of managing group energy and haunted by depression. 

                Regardless of who you are, this card confirms the words of the poet Rumi: light passes where the wound is, but you are not defined by your wound. You do not own others' wounds, although you may have assumed that responsibility. Each time you connect with your true self, light can flow through the cracks and into the world, eventually healing the wounds and shining brightly. The heavy burden and responsibility that a sensitive heart may impose will be lifted, becoming blessings in your life. Your journey involves birthing light and embracing the freedom of a free soul. You are loved by the Universe and are likely an earthly angel. Take comfort and encouragement from this card.

## Roots

You may be a conscious creator who has learned from past mistakes. This card signifies that as a result, you are poised to reap better outcomes ahead. A challenging period or painful relationship may have concluded because the old roots have been severed. Celebrate your growth and anticipate the sweeter fruits that await you now.

               However, if you find yourself facing numerous disappointments, feelings of alienation, or other difficulties, it may be beneficial to examine the mindsets and energies you are embracing. Be open to evaluating the intentions you are setting in motion, as they may be influencing outcomes you don't desire. Consider uprooting old thought patterns that no longer serve you, ensuring you stop perpetuating unwanted situations. Your intentions play a crucial role in shaping the quality of your harvest.

                The Roots card celebrates wise choices, self-discipline, and the ability to follow through on your decisions. At your core, you are a powerful manifestor capable of sowing ideas and bringing creative visions to life. Manifestation can occur rapidly or require patience over time, with fruits that grow slowly often lasting the longest. Trust the process of creation and have patience when awaiting results.

                This card also emphasizes understanding your needs as a magical creator. Use the right ingredients—your thoughts and choices—to manifest your deepest wishes and longings. Your choices are like seeds planted in the ground, some yielding strong roots while others remain fragile. If your self-perception is fragile, positive experiences of self-worth and self-love may struggle to take root. Focus on cultivating attractive thoughts and intentions in your life, visualizing yourself as capable, valuable, and beautiful. You have the ability to manifest anything you dream of through willpower, healthy thoughts, and persistent effort. Commit to doing the inner work necessary to reap the benefits you desire. Set this intention daily upon waking and before sleeping, infusing your life with positivity and love. This practice acts as a magical sprinkle over life, bringing sunshine even to the darkest corners of your body and soul. Fill the soil of your life with good intentions and love, nurturing the growth of the best fruits.

                Participating in life with your unique vibration is a blessing. Trust in your ability to create beautiful things. When your true vibration is filling your thoughts, intentions, and inner life with positive energy, miracles happen! Trust in that.

## The Circle

This card emphasizes the importance of inner space and boundaries. Visualize creating a protective circle around yourself and your aura, ensuring that this space is filled with everything that defines you. This sphere holds your essence and resources and is vital for your well-being. Within this space, you reside, breathe, think, and assert your personal power. It should remain entirely private, providing you with the capacity to navigate each day.
      
               Weak or random boundaries are akin to leaving a house window wide open, inviting everything in. It's crucial to maintain clear and well-defined distinctions between what is private and what is public. This card symbolizes your everyday energy reserves—emotional, mental, and physical—which are precious resources that you control. You decide how to allocate your energy, where to invest, stretch, or replenish.

                Activities like meditation, yoga, and self-care can replenish your energy reserves. Engage in activities that bring joy and boost your mood and confidence. Be mindful of individuals who may try to drain your energy through various means, influencing or imposing thoughts that hinder your authenticity.
      
               Ultimately, the responsibility for maintaining a positive energy environment rests with you. The vibration within your circle influences how you communicate, both verbally and non-verbally, impacting interactions with others.

                Drawing this card may indicate that boundaries are becoming more significant or that you are learning where your boundaries lie. Making profound choices for your development and healing might attract individuals who challenge your judgment or push you to revert to old patterns. It may also be the Universe testing you by sending people into your life who become too intrusive.View this as an opportunity for growth and assertiveness. Visualize protecting your circle by surrounding it with a rim of gold and filling it with light and spiritual energy. Maintain a high vibration within your circle by nurturing thoughts and feelings that affirm and support you. Cleanse negativity through activities or rituals that neutralize or elevate frequencies, allowing yourself to reject negative energies that do not serve you.

                Alternatively, this card can signify successful partnerships and relationships built on shared values and common goals. Embrace good energy, openness, and effective communication within these connections, creating space to share strengths and weaknesses and complement each other excellently.

## The Juggler

This card may indicate individuals who manipulate the truth and seek to exert control over situations. They derive satisfaction from manipulating outcomes or feeling superior and entitled. These individuals may fabricate stories or distort reality for personal gain, using emotions and words to influence others negatively towards you. Such manipulative behaviors are often seen in group settings and can appear credible to others. The manipulator may use tactics like confusion, lies, silence, or verbal attacks that can be emotionally distressing or triggering. Recognizing and navigating these dynamics is essential for maintaining clarity and protecting yourself from harm.
      
      The juggler is motivated by a desire to establish a deeper connection with you, using you as a source of security, specialness, and protection from internal insecurities and shame. They gain a sense of control and satisfaction when they weaken you or expose you to emotional discomfort in life situations. These individuals are often charismatic and social, enjoying directing and influencing others to energize themselves.

                This card may indicate that you will face situations where you need to defend yourself or navigate ongoing challenges with such individuals. It's crucial to gather strength and support from trusted allies to address these challenges effectively. Creating a plan and maintaining composure are smart strategies. Avoid exposing the manipulator publicly or getting emotional; instead, speak truthfully from your perspective without overexplaining. 

                Reflect on how you may have allowed the juggler's influence and identify qualities or behaviors that made you vulnerable. As someone sensitive and empathetic, you might feel guilt and tend to overexplain or give too much, creating fertile ground for manipulative individuals. Acknowledge the need to balance kindness and self-preservation, recognizing that not everyone will appreciate your intentions. Explore the qualities of being nonchalant yet clear and friendly within yourself, allowing these aspects to shine through positively. Use your breath and inner strength to stay calm and courageous, maintaining empathy while setting healthy boundaries to prevent further manipulation. 

                Another interpretation of this card is that it signifies your cleverness and skills that can be further developed. Ensure that your ideas and plans are aligned and coordinated to achieve favorable outcomes. Utilize your resources effectively and avoid conflicting strategies to maximize success.

## Snowfall

This card suggests that organized living and increased self-control are essential. You are being called to be disciplined in matters that have a significant influence on your life. It's important to follow through on commitments and preparations you've made, keeping appointments and completing actions promptly to avoid being derailed by unexpected events or distractions. Do not postpone anything that can be done today. While things may appear clear and straightforward now, it's wise to refrain from wearing rose-colored glasses. The path ahead may not remain clear indefinitely. Unexpected challenges, like an overnight snowfall blocking a road, can arise suddenly. Stay proactive and prepared to navigate potential obstacles that may appear unexpectedly.
                 
                 This card cautions against unexpected surprises or situations that can catch you off guard. Things may become confusing or take a completely different direction than you thought. If you haven't adequately prepared or put in the necessary work, you may encounter obstacles or find it challenging to complete tasks. It indicates potential delays or the need for adjustments to achieve your goals. Exercise caution and remain attentive to unfolding events.

                 Alternatively, a snowfall symbolizes hidden aspects or truths that are not fully revealed at present. It may be wise to investigate further or wait for developments before making significant decisions, allowing time for clarity to emerge.

## Ray of light

Recognition and positive surprises may be on the way. You are likely to receive gifts and delightful rewards. In practical matters, projects, or collaborations, the card signals prosperity, growth, and favorable outcomes.

                It also represents the ability to heal through the sacred ray of light. Within your heart is a vibration that expresses the truth of divine being. This light glows and permeates your body and aura, becoming visible to others. It can be directed to places and people through your thoughts and focus. The light conveys a comforting truth that all is well in times of crisis or intense emotions. It's akin to a director entering a dramatic stage to remind us that life is just a play. This healing vibration dispels ignorance and painful illusions, much like fresh water flowing into dirty corners and cleansing them. This power is authentic and transformative, capable of correcting distortions, dispelling fear, and illuminating spiritual identity and presence.

                The ray of light is not exclusive to anyone; it is the inherent light vibration of our origin and lineage, accessible to all through their heart. However, expressing this light requires maturity, surrender, and a developed soul. This light is noticeable and can create immediate ripple effects. It has the power to change entrenched conflicts or illnesses, bringing suppressed issues into the light and profoundly impacting situations and individuals. It reaches others precisely where they need it most, like a warm sensation spreading through a cold body or a revealing light beckoning someone out of a cave.
              
               Empaths have a natural ability to evoke this effect in others, reminding them of their spiritual essence and home.

## The Scapegoat

This card symbolizes a challenging yet transformative role—the role of the scapegoat. The scapegoat is someone who does not benefit from group dynamics and cannot draw strength or validation from them. This position offers a profound opportunity to break free from illusions and undergo spiritual transformation. Despite the pain, the scapegoat has the potential to bring light and healing into the world. They serve as a crucial portal for spiritual evolution, symbolizing the universal wounds that all humans carry but which are often projected onto the scapegoat more than anyone else.
                
                The wound within is where spiritual light can be birthed within each individual. If you have a scapegoat in your life, take care and show compassion towards them. If you recognize children or adults embodying these roles, send them positive thoughts, light, and attention. View them as hidden diamonds and jewels awaiting discovery. They need support to discover their true worth and their true selves. Many may struggle immensely due to the burdens they carry. But the truth sets the scapegoat free. With the assistance of empathetic and supportive individuals as guides or "midwives," the scapegoat can heal and transform, emerging as a source of strength and wisdom for themselves and others. 

                If you identify with being a scapegoat, heed this message from the oracles: You are not responsible for others' feelings. Taking on this burden deprives you of love and joy. This card invites you to step out of the shadows of projected energies and false beliefs imposed upon you by others.  You have likely internalized untrue thoughts and attitudes about yourself. Begin gently by exploring and uncovering what lies hidden in the shadows. This card suggests that a radiant inner power is waiting to be unleashed, leading to a transformative new life situation. Allow this spiritual process to unfold at its own pace and embrace healing along the way. Surround yourself with safe and supportive individuals, and make it a daily practice to affirm yourself with love and compassion. You deserve to step into the light and reclaim your true essence.

## Theater

This card serves as a reminder of life's theater, where you have a role written in the heavenly script and that you have chosen your own destiny. However, it also offers an opportunity to step out of any painful roles you may be playing. Visualize yourself on life's stage, playing your chosen role, and then stepping off the stage as the curtain lowers. You leave the role behind, able to reminisce about it but no longer carrying it with you. Now step out of the building and watch as the theater gradually fades from your radar. When you turn around, it's barely visible in the distance. Move towards a new horizon. Pause one last time and look back. The theater has completely vanished. You try to peer through binoculars, squinting and searching, but it's no longer there. Your role is no longer a part of your life. You are free to embrace something new and take positions that affirm your uniqueness. You move towards a new horizon filled with creative thoughts and fresh insights. Look towards the sky and discover fireworks among the stars, symbolizing credible discoveries and new beginnings.

                 Another interpretation of this card suggests that someone may be playing a role and hiding their true intentions from you. It's advisable to remain cautious and refrain from sharing too much about yourself or your projects. Observe how things unfold before taking action. This could also relate to someone masking low self-esteem out of fear of rejection or disappointment. As a sensitive person, you may easily discern these behaviors, but avoid being overly influenced by others' insecurities. Meet them with understanding and love, refraining from judgment.

                 Consider whether you may also be wearing masks, and embrace the refreshing breeze that comes with taking them off, allowing yourself to be authentic and true.

## Thermometer

The "thermometer" metaphorically represents a tool for maintaining a healthy balance and atmosphere within your social circle or environment. It encourages you to tune into your inner space and discern what energy and influences belong to you versus others.  If you are sensitive, you might absorb energies, tensions, and attitudes from your surroundings. It's essential to periodically evaluate your home environment and conduct inner cleansing practices to release any accumulated energies that do not serve your well-being.
                 
                 If you feel connected to lower vibrations, whether it's another person or an event lingering around you, raise the frequencies in that area. Be present, as this allows the light to transcend and work for you. Meditate, use oils, or mantras to release fear or negative energies. Note that feelings of stress, anger, fear, or discomfort can originate from both within yourself and others. Set aside enough time to sort out what is yours. This will also help you reduce internal pressure each time it builds up. Make sure you don't misinterpret or project your issues onto something or someone else, and likewise, don't adopt others' fears and thoughts.
                 
                 
                 The inner thermometer is a valuable tool for maintaining good and healthy energy flow and utilization within yourself. By practicing and trusting the signals it provides, you can develop a strong internal barometer.

                 The thermometer is also a method to assess whether people are safe for you or not. Furthermore, it helps determine whether projects and environments are free from unrest and noise, or toxic group dynamics. It is especially important for you as a sensitive individual to have trusting relationships where people take responsibility for their own emotions and weaknesses and do not use manipulation techniques or projection. It's crucial to protect yourself from assuming responsibility for others' emotions or carrying their projected symptoms. Pay attention to environments and individuals with unnatural barriers that restrict space for your energy and expression. Signs of this may include feeling mental and verbal resistance, experiencing an increase in inner criticism, and losing touch with logical thinking and coping skills. You might find yourself constantly managing stress and nervousness, leading to exhaustion. Another common sign is seeking excessive validation from others and placing undue importance on their opinions. 

                 Remember to listen to your body's signals to determine when you are in a welcoming and relaxing environment. A relaxed nervous system is always a good sign. When the body feels safe, your energy will flow freely, allowing you to be socially engaged and fully present. This is the signals that you are in the right climate for your well-being.Take the temperature over time to avoid overthinking or projecting scenarios onto people and environments that don't align with reality. Learn to differentiate between inner struggles and self-sabotage versus genuinely unhealthy environments that create poor living conditions. Don't become paranoid about using this tool, but rather apply the thermometer as an excellent tool for both self-care and growth!

                Your beautiful soul possesses an inner beauty that often shines through and is visible to others.

If this resonates with you, you may be a catalyst for the divine light that many seek and long for.

## The Window

There are always two views through a window. This card reminds you not to assume or believe that others see the same as you do. Be open to the possibility that things are different than you think. The card may signal various cultures or perspectives that need to be considered. Show understanding that others have a different standpoint, different glasses, and a different approach to things. Avoid attributing thoughts, intentions, or perspectives to people that they do not actually hold, especially based on misunderstandings arising from different lifestyles and values. When you look out of your window, your view is influenced by filters that you may not even realize you have. Similarly, when others stand on the opposite side of the window looking at you, they see through their own filters. The message of this card is clear on that.  There is a risk that you might be confining yourself within a self-imposed prison, influenced by a negative self-image. It is important to make choices that help you break free from this mindset. Work on keeping your "window" clear and free from filters and shadows. Allow light to come in and help you fully accept and embrace yourself.
                
                You're much better off than you think and should take the chance to invite more people in to get to know you. You'll benefit from showing yourself true and authentic. Then others cannot create fantasies or misconceptions about you but can see you more clearly for who you truly are. This clarity fosters a sense of safety and transparency for both you and others.
                
                This card encourages honesty and visibility, which can lead to positive outcomes and deeper connections. Don't overthink or overly focus on yourself and your appearance. Instead, practice forgiveness and show care towards the parts of yourself that you criticize or struggle to accept. You don't need to strive for perfection; embrace your imperfect beauty. Let this card remind you that you are inherently good enough and deserving of claiming your rightful place in the sun, just as you are.
                
                Another meaning: If you're seeking clarity on a specific matter or outcome, it's important to be transparent and honest without being misled by illusions or fantasies. Avoid hiding information and instead, be brave and straightforward in your approach.

                 The "Vitamin" card supports choices that reinforce your true identity and break away from harmful group dynamics and sabotaging mindsets. Identifying and distinguishing these elements in your life will be important.

                 It also signifies self-development and inner work that counteracts a negative role or "the weaker link" within you.

## Grow inward

You have everything within you. Turn inward to unleash the power you need. You will find the solutions and answers within yourself. Also, seek inward to find the security and assurance you are looking for. If you want confirmation that you are good enough, that you can master something, that you are equal to others, then this card is an invitation to find it within yourself and not from other people. Only you can confirm yourself. This truth will reveal itself when you search for it with conviction that you will find it. When you open your heart and take the chance, you will receive both relief and inner assurance that can fill you with peace. This is also an indication that you are wise to follow the inner feeling, and not let yourself be swayed by ruminative thoughts in a specific situation. If you follow such thoughts, they can lead you astray to unnecessary things. You may end up on new trains of thought, often influenced by others, that remove you from receptivity and overview in the present moment. Suddenly, you find yourself in a setting of nervousness, stress, and misunderstandings.


                You follow the inner feeling by keeping the focus on the sensation that lives beneath the chest. Note that you make contact with the heart and gain a greater overview through it. Trust that the creative unique power that the heart holds is safe to lean on, and that you can let it overflow with fear and doubt. This heart-energy will eventually fill your thoughts and senses, and give off a fine radiance that attracts the best solutions. A correct interpretation of the situation will also be reflected back to you, and you avoid making wrong assessments. This you can choose to do in all settings and areas of life when you are faced with issues or making important decisions.


                Sometimes the card may warn against taking control of challenging situations and emotions by growing outward. It means that you may be tempted to take charge with power or persuasion, or take up space that does not belong to you. You may grow into others' power fields and disrupt and influence others in an unfavorable way. You may become too eager and have too strong opinions about things you have nothing to do with.


                Remember, as a life rule: You should only grow into your own power field and that is more than enough. Focus inward and settle into the core of yourself. Visualize it as a golden chair that fits you perfectly. From here, you send out your light and everything will fall into place. You are in balance and have the inner certainty that all is well. Remind yourself that EVERYTHING of value in your life comes from the inner center and can never be lost!"

## The moment

This card is a strong indicator that the truth about a situation or circumstance has come to light. If you are seeking answers, it may mean that you are on the right track. Situations, relationships, and details in matters are exactly as you think and believe.

 This card could also signify a moment of self-discovery where you gain deeper insights into who you truly are. You might realize that you have held onto beliefs about yourself that are not accurate, and now these falsehoods are being exposed. This newfound clarity about your own energy and identity can bring joy and gratitude. It's a golden opportunity for integration and transformation if you're open to it. Embrace curiosity and act upon new impressions and insights that arise during this time. By doing so, you can embark on a journey of personal growth and positive change.

 The transformation that this card may herald will only be effective if you make new choices through clear intuitive thoughts. You must validate them and work to bypass the tendency to fall back into old patterns of limited thinking. Embrace and cherish each of these moments as they arise, and express your readiness to the Universe for further growth and experiences. 
 
 If a moment reveals uncomfortable truths about relationships and groups you belong to, it's important not to dismiss this information. As a sensitive person focused on kindness and empathy, you may struggle to see others in a negative light. However, it's essential to recognize that you do not create this perspective; life shows you how things truly are.  You may be experiencing hidden projections and identifying with a role that undermines your well-being. This realization can bring awareness to painful dynamics between you and others, where you unintentionally enable others while downplaying your own worth. Perhaps someone relies on seeing you as less capable than you are, actively contributing to keeping you in the shadows and hindering your growth. If you are being used as a pawn in this way, it can significantly limit and impact your life. 
 
 The moment that will awaken you may come to you hundreds of times, and each time you must invest in removing yourself as this pawn. There may be doubts about whether these moments are true and if you are deceiving yourself. Resistance and feelings of guilt may arise, influencing you to dismiss the insights.
 
                 The saying goes, "Life is a matter between you and God," so ultimately, who should you live for? This card is a strong call to face the truth. It invites you to make a commitment to live freely, embracing the presumption of freedom that is available to you here and now. Most likely, there will be many moments where you slipp back into habitual thinking or act in fear and dread. But this is just the beginning. Over time, practicing healthy boundaries and self-care will become more natural and essential to your well-being and the only right thing to do!

               Another meaning: This card may suggest that being present in the moment is crucial and beneficial. If you find yourself eagerly awaiting an answer or feeling impatient about a particular matter, the card advises you to release those thoughts and settle into the present moment. Things will work out.

# Deck: everydayOraclesArr

## 2 + 2 = 4

You might find it uncomfortable to state that two plus two equals four, even though this fact is so evident. Your assertiveness might now be challenged. You could be tempted to say that two plus two equals five because others claim it to be so, and you feel afraid of asserting the truth. This card strongly advises you to be brave and take the risk of standing in your own truth, rather than conforming to lies for safety. Do not fight the truth just so you can agree with other people. You must declare that two plus two actually does equal four and stand up for this being both true and right. It is always better to stand alone rather than agree with something you know is not right for you. Grow comfortable with standing in this unsteady boat. The 2+2 card promises that this choice will give you stability and strength in your own self-worth. As time passes, your assertiveness will feel more comfortable and natural.

Most likely, someone will step in to support you and your cause, validating your position and helping you make sound decisions as you move forward. Trust in what you know to be right and true; don’t give up your power just to feel secure. Your doubts stem from a fear of standing alone, influenced by external sources that distort reality. In such times, the logical can seem illogical, and standing up for the truth becomes challenging. The Lawyer symbolizes a person or force that will advocate for you, lending their authority to amplify your voice.

 This card may also signify that you are gaining access to a part of yourself with greater inner authority. However, it often indicates that others will appear in your life to help you and take on this role. Everything will work out. Relax, be clear in your intentions, and keep your spirits high. Good luck!

## Anxiety

There is a significant gap between your internal and external life. This suggests that you may not be expressing your true needs and might feel undeserving or unable to accept what you truly require. You are holding up a mask between yourself and others, overthinking situations and feelings. Perhaps you’ve given too much of yourself in relationships, which has weakened your sense of self-worth. You might be experiencing pain and confusion as you awaken to the reality that you deserve more, but your feelings have yet to catch up. Anxiety may arise unexpectedly, draining your energy and overwhelming you. These feelings persist because you’ve suppressed emotions and natural impulses for too long. There are many aspects of yourself with needs and feelings that you’ve denied. It’s time to let these parts of you speak so you can reclaim a sense of safety and comfort in your life, enabling you to step into a more mature role.

This card is a reminder of perseverance and hope. You are encouraged to maintain a positive outlook and resist the urge to worry or fall into negative thought patterns.

## The Book

The situation requires you to go in-depth and take a closer look. You’re encouraged to let go of your need to analyze and define and instead focus on what is immediately facing you. Be open to alternative solutions; things might look different than you planned. Be an empty vessel. The situation doesn't show the whole truth. This card encourages you to permit new information to enter. Allow impulses to rise from the depths of the book. This will happen when you read with feeling and empathy rather than with thoughts and pondering. Feel which emotions arise with the book’s content. Focus on these feelings, sink into them, and see them grow. Maybe this will reveal brand new emotions. Meet these in the same way, and be amazed by the information that comes to your mind. It can be in the form of intuitive thoughts, story fragments, and minor signs. Pieces of the puzzle might fall into place for you and give you a new understanding of what is really going on. Make this effort, and you will gain greater clarity.

This card can also indicate literary skills and future book publications.

## The Bridge

You are currently transitioning into something new. It is like a bridge or passage into a brand new part of life or a new outcome. This is a transition phase. It may confuse you because there is no clarity and unobstructed view. It feels fragmented and unsafe. Your life today is undefined, and you cannot see its direction. It can be easy to get caught up in details and focus too much on a specific moment’s feelings. 
               
 This card advises you to be patient. Even though you want clear answers, and need certainty, make yourself comfortable standing on this bridge in a waiting position. With time you will take the plunge and step into something new. Conditions will soon improve. You will know when the time is right, so do not lose heart. You are heading into advanced and more fruitful lands, which are better than those you are leaving behind.

## The Diamond

Congratulations. You currently have or will soon acquire something of great value. The diamond represents the best possible discovery.

## Fragrance

Choose luminous thoughts in the situation you are currently facing. This will be of benefit to you and create a brighter atmosphere that will be advantageous. Thoughts are like fragrances. Remind yourself of how pleasing it is to stand next to a person who smells good, like fresh, gentle flowers. Think about how positive your feelings towards this type of person are and how welcome they are to you. Then remind yourself of what it feels like to stand next to someone with a musty and stuffy smell. Recall the type of feelings you had towards this person. Thoughts and frequencies give off a fragrance that others notice. You need to be aware of your energy and what emanates from you out into your surroundings. This is the time when smelling good is particularly beneficial. Your current position might be leaving you more vulnerable than usual, or you may currently have a greater influence. You are now being noticed, so make sure you arrive at the party freshly showered.

---

## The Empath

You are likely an empath who can identify with others deeply. You see and notice things that are not apparent. You have a general insight into information that is hidden from most people. The subjects can be the past, attitudes, intentions, and thoughts. You will be able to experience others’ energy states and feelings at the same levels that they do. Sometimes people live in a state of denial and projection. In these situations, you’ll be able to empathize with their drama and feel the energy of their choices and their karma. Being an empath is both a gift and a challenge. It is a gift because of its blessing to give others affirmation and spread light and hope into fixed life situations. You uplift the collective energy to higher levels of truth and a transparent way of life. You become an image of unconditional love and understanding, and others may turn to you for advice and guidance. However, it is also a challenge in that you are especially vulnerable and exposed. You experience things beyond your own destiny and can feel much of life’s pain. Others may turn against you because you perceive matters they do not want you to see. Individuals or groups may feel threatened by you and therefore start blaming or working against you. You must protect yourself and seek support from bright, robust, and insightful people. This card can also suggest that you are a pioneer. You represent the idea that every person is united as one, and others look up to you.
 
 Sometimes this card means you have empaths in your immediate family or circle of friends, and it can be about highly developed children that need your support and affirmation.

## Adventure

Things are not as they appear. This card indicates the possibility of recurring events and dynamics based on misunderstandings you would prefer to be without. Look for hidden meaning in stories that keep repeating in your life. Know that challenging situations end when you have learned your lessons. Scary or conflict-filled aspects of the challenge will fall away entirely when the truth is revealed, just like the trolls in fairy tales that burst when hit by sunlight. You need new and creative solutions in your mind to avoid the tendency to carry old, stagnant energy. You need to be optimistic. A way to get there can be viewing life as an adventure where everything is possible, and situations can change anytime. And that story always ends happily. Trust in this! Allow this attitude to be reflected in the life situation you currently find yourself in. Things are, in fact, better than you think.
 
 This card can also mean that there are valuable messages for you in the form of symbols. You will be enlightened in an area that has felt unclear, and things that have stayed hidden will now come into the light.

## Feathers

It is time to exercise gentleness and caution. The feather is represented here with wisdom and softness. It also characterizes air and change. You are being encouraged to treat situations with love and consideration. Approach life’s circumstances and other people with care. Be aware of your thoughts and feelings, and consider what you transfer to your surroundings. Work on processing and centering so that you appear as gentle as possible and do not convey hardness or harshness. Even if something triggers you and you feel like raising your hackles and making a stand, this is not in your best interest. Take a feather in your hands. Trace it over your arm and focus on the feeling. This is the best way for you to proceed here and now.

---

## The fly

When the Fly appears, it can indicate that stressful energies or forces surround you. They can even come from people or environments you do not see as threats. They do not necessarily seem to affect you directly. However, they can still be a point of unease in your life and cause deep stress. The fly can represent people who create disturbances in different ways, and that causes you difficulty and loss. 
    
    The fly can also illustrate a dysfunctional system, pattern, or set of thoughts. In some instances, it can denote being part of a system that is not advantageous: Where the fly is aggressive, insistent, opinionated, and wants to control you. For example, this can imply a pattern of thought you are trying to rid yourself of or a negative family culture you wish to escape. The fly poses no real danger. You are never afraid of a fly; it is just a persistent annoyance. Some flies make noise. Most of them are so fast that you can never quite catch them, although they always stay close by. This card asks you to be aware and handle a fly correctly. It is asking you to stay away from the fly swatter! Just open up your window and give it no attention.
    
    This card might also represent negative thinking that should be ignored.

---

## Footprints

You are being noticed and, in turn, can influence others. This can be centered around your personality or ideas and knowledge becoming beneficial. This means you can significantly influence groups or gain a foothold within an organization or system. This card can indicate a considerable impression that later could become guidelines for others. The effort you are now making will be impactful, both if you see the result and if you do not. You might be an innovator who holds solutions and thought patterns that can alter attitudes and result in user growth and change. Some people might allow themselves to be bothered by you and try to ignore or criticize you. Do not pay them any attention because these people often have lower frequencies and no collective vision. Stay positive and remain active. You will make a powerful mark in penetrating old-fashioned behavior and bring new, fresh energy and openness. This card represents lasting influence and good results.

---

## Fear

This card indicates that you may have experienced feelings of helplessness, powerlessness, and vulnerability, which might have scared you. You are afraid of these emotions and events of the past repeating themselves. This could have created a fear within you that sabotages new opportunities and positive everyday life. The issue can be a fear of living your life, interacting with others, or trusting in your own feelings. You may fear making choices, making mistakes, choosing a partner, showing off, showing vulnerability, being proud, or carrying your worth. Ultimately, of taking your place in life. All this is fear that originates in distrust towards yourself and towards life. It is not true, nor is it real. The fear is learned and destructive and has no supportive function. It will lead to unresolved potential and create unnecessary pain if you do not confront it. Don’t let yourself be limited by fear. Only tolerate it long enough to be able to face your inner trolls and release the resources that are hidden there. You will gain power and the courage to live your life, make mistakes, and be vulnerable. Then you will see things as they truly are. You will be relieved to have finally taken on this confrontation.
 
 This card can also represent an unfounded fear of action. You have nothing to dread, and you will be well served by defying your anxieties. Good results shall follow.

## Leading Light

This card suggests that you need a guiding light to help you navigate through challenging terrain. It may indicate a time of trial, with hidden obstacles or unexpected conflicts that could arise. This guiding light will help you move forward safely and securely, showing you the way and acting as a beacon. You are encouraged to seek out this guidance, as it is now within your reach. This might refer to a person you already know—someone wise and trustworthy—or it could mean that a new person will soon appear in your life. Trust your intuition and pay attention to the people you encounter in your daily activities. You may not realize it at first, but suddenly, the light will become clear to you.

The guiding light might also come in the form of online resources, such as inspiring figures, videos, or groups. Make an effort to connect with these sources, as they will be highly valuable to you, providing the exact insight you need.

Additionally, this card advises exploring new interests, hobbies, or pursuits. Fresh inspiration and a new mindset could bring significant benefits to your life.

---

## Toxic Energy

Relationships, situations, and environments can be toxic when people consciously or unconsciously leak bad intentions. This can be caused by jealousy, suppressed emotions, prolonged patterns of abuse, and a need to weaken others in order to feel safe. It creates a general lack of light, air, and acceptance, in the energy exchange, which can lead to struggle and competition. At best, it is tiring and energy consuming.
 
 This card asks you to be wary of this form of harmful energy. You might have drawn it because you are exposed to attacks from individuals. Be completely aware of setting your boundaries if this resonates with you. Typical signs are attacks on your self-worth and the undermining of you and your accomplishments. Toxic energy directed at you personally acts as a spear and will cause you pain. This can be on a soul, emotional or physical level. Take the necessary precautions to protect yourself by ending communication, practicing firm boundaries, and self-healing. 
               
 This card can also speak of an environment where interactions alternate between clarity and ambiguity, where it is difficult to ascertain what is going on. Trust your inner experience. Never accept toxic spears, and don’t explain them away. Also, never choose to give away your power to feel safe, for money, for help, or to hide the shame. Choose instead to stand in your insecurities and own your power and your experience. Knowing where you are bleeding and feel you have no value is precisely where the spears can hit. It is essential (though) to remind ourselves that the physical world is only a shell of the spiritual world, so you can feel perfectly safe.
 
 Sometimes this card reflect your own energies and advise you to be careful with what you think about other people: Practice self-examination.

You will throw a lifeline to someone else and fight for that person. They can be near or far, a person, a group, or a cause. Your willingness to incur discomfort, pain and fear in this fight makes you a hero in the eyes of others. Indeed, you are a hero. Most people prefer harmony, safety, and predictability in their daily life. This also applies to you, but you are willing to accept toil and loss of comfort for a while.

Additionally, this card may indicate that you are about to embark on a new path or journey. The way ahead appears clear and promising, and you will be able to handle any challenges that arise. Lastly, this card might reflect your innate drive to help others or animals, showcasing your loving and compassionate nature.

---

## The helper

This card suggests that individuals who wish to help you may enter your life, recognizing your vulnerability and empathy. They may see that you are in a phase of seeking, open to advice, and receptive to influence. While it’s important to be open to support, this card advises you to remain skeptical and discerning about the new people in your life.

Maintain healthy boundaries and don’t feel compelled to share everything about yourself. It’s fine to open up a little, but if you find yourself divulging too much too quickly, this card signals a need to hold back. Entering an intimate relationship too soon can lead to unhealthy dynamics and cause you unnecessary turmoil.

The Helper card could warn about individuals driven by a need for control. Such people may project their own issues onto others and make others responsible for their internal conflicts. Sometimes, those with complex personal lives might use their role as a helper to avoid their own discomfort and vulnerability, masking their struggles with a facade of goodness. Be clear about your boundaries and assert them firmly. Accept help if it feels right, but stay cautious and retain a healthy level of skepticism.

Additionally, this card might reflect a tendency for you to fall into the helper role or remain in relationships where you are subjected to projection. Continue to introspect and reassess your actions to ensure you are not compromising your own well-being.

## Homework

The homework is not given to vex you, but rather, it is meant to benefit you. Put in the amount of work that is necessary. 
               
The card can also speak of the benefits of looking closer at things and delving deeper into their dynamics. You need to make an effort and study to understand better. You will then be able to handle future events much better. The idea is to stay up to date and be well prepared. Put in this work, and the card promises good prospects and brilliant results. Whatever you do, do not skip your homework. You will regret it later.

## Handwriting

This card indicates that awareness of your handwriting can be beneficial to you. You can trust your writing because it reveals your energy frequency. Sometimes it can show your energy exchange with someone else. It can uncover dishonesty and prevent you from making bad choices. When you write, how well do your words flow? Do you find that the words hold power and credibility? Does the pen flow smoothly, and do you feel that your body and inner knowledge support your writing? Pay attention to when your handwriting appears messy or irregular or when the force waivers. This can indicate that you need to centre yourself before moving on with your mission. There may be good reasons to not sign a contract or agreement. 
               
Take some time when you write your name. Every time you sign something, be true to yourself and consider confident handwriting as a stamp of approval. You have value, be proud, and feel ownership of your handwriting. This is a great way to practice self-worth.

## Glue

This card reveals that you are being held back by past experiences and old baggage. Holding onto outdated realities, situations, and emotions will hinder new growth and prevent the long-awaited changes you seek. Recognize that certain negative attitudes are hindering your progress. When good fortune comes knocking, these attitudes act like sticky glue and sabotaging the new possibilities before they have a chance to develop. 

At times, life may seem harsh and impenetrable, devoid of light and air, which can lead to feelings of mistrust and dissatisfaction. This sticky glue from the past keeps old patterns alive, causing unfortunate situations to repeat and fostering unwarranted distrust of new people and relationships. But now is the time to address and release the old baggage. Process and dissolve the past so you can forgive and make way for healing and renewal. It’s time to organize and move on. Commit to rejecting old attitudes today, remove the glue from your life. You will soon be filled with fresh, positive energy!

## The Crystal

Drawing this card reflects your inner energy structures. You embody crystal-like qualities with transformative properties, positioning yourself as a natural healer and peace mediator. This is the path you are destined for, and some may already recognize this aspect of themselves.
The card also highlights your strong charisma and kind nature, which can act as a healing presence for others. You might excel as a caregiver or counselor. The Crystal card signifies powerful spiritual abilities within you, suggesting that you have the potential to be a life alchemist.

Transforming energies is a significant responsibility. You may have the capacity to absorb and elevate energies, thereby altering energy dynamics and positively influencing situations. This skill extends to healing illnesses and injuries, as well as transforming toxic relationships and negative scenarios. Your high vibrational energy can bring about positive changes by drawing on spiritual principles you have access to. While this role is powerful, it may also feel overwhelming at times.
Although you have the option to offer help when it feels appropriate, remember not to take on the responsibility for others' energies. Spend time discovering the best methods and approaches for you if this type of work resonates with you.

---

## Kundalini

Divine power is awakening within you. This card suggests that this power is either already active in your body or will be soon. Kundalini, the divine energy, may become more intense and start to clear the blockages hindering your true spiritual self. This process might be intense and could resurface old baggage and painful wounds. For some, it may manifest as physical sensations like twitching, unusual noises, or strange movements. Do not be alarmed, as these are signs of powerful healing.

This card encourages you to shift your focus from the illusory world to spiritual practices. You may find yourself needing more disciplined spiritual routines. This could also lead to developing spiritual insight and a deeper connection with your higher self, revealing extraordinary abilities and a new sense of reality. Life’s scenery might become profoundly meaningful, with even small things like a tree or insect bringing great joy. Your senses will become sharper, and you will gain a clearer understanding of yourself. The gap between your earthly role and higher self will gradually close, allowing you to manage your ego's needs with greater detachment and observation.

The awakening of your kundalini is a significant gift. Although it involves challenges and internal work, it is to your advantage and signifies a remarkable breakthrough. This card may also represent special abilities; you could have been born into this world with high, spiritual energies accessible to you from an early age. Lastly, the card may indicate the importance of holy paths and sites.

This pond represents a space where you can admit your regrets, seek forgiveness, and release negative thoughts and prejudices.

You might be carrying feelings of remorse for past actions or betrayals, or you might regret thoughts or judgments you've had about others. Perhaps you've been struggling with a lack of responsibility or conscience. It’s time to release these burdens. Visualize this magical pond in front of you.

## Manipulator

This card warns against manipulation: It may be at work, with friends, children, family, or somewhere else where the central figures utilize manipulative methods. Here the importance of controlling the story is central. The person in question is not being honest about their intentions. They wish to guide the outcomes and control what others think and how they interpret a particular situation. Be aware. This might involve you personally; you may be the target or a witness. You are advised to be conscious and hold on to the truth. Do not allow yourself to become unnerved. A manipulator will try to spread uncertainty and make the air foggy so that it is easy to acquire this person's desired point of view, despite the fact that it goes against common sense. The most important advice for keeping an unobscured view through all the confusion is to remain clear and brave and not give in. You are advised to centre yourself and visualize an inner column of power that permeates your body. Allow this column to vibrate through every part of you: Stand steady in the knowledge of recognizing what is going on and having no reason to be afraid. The truth will come out. You will radiate the light, illuminating the situation and relieving everyone involved. Trust that the universe will ensure that the manipulator does not prevail.

A crossroads is emerging ahead, forcing you to make reassessments. Perhaps you should choose a new path or direction. This pause is an important one, no matter the reason for it. It is time for digesting and processing and for taking a deep breath. Feel secure in knowing that activity will pick up again when it is supposed to.

This card may also indicate that a task is completed and it is time to stop. This might be the time to end or put on hold a particular situation, relationship, or a particular contact.

---

## The Minister

Be responsible, disciplined, and authoritative. You are strong enough and can fulfill the task with brilliance. You are the minister of your own department because you hold the primary responsibility for your earthly life. Being a minister demands many attributes from you and is a role that must be taken seriously. Only then will situations have a favorable outcome in the long run. This card indicates that you may tend to leave big and important decisions to others. You might believe that it is better if others clean up a situation or take responsibility for specific issues because they are more listened to and have a greater impact. However, that is your lack of confidence and experience fooling you. It is time to take responsibility for your own department and strengthen your feelings of self-worth. Award yourself the authority to act on important life issues and stand up for yourself! This card promises that you will find relief in the following security and overview. It is time to go to work.

The card may also indicate that you are being awarded higher responsibility at work and will gain a leadership role. Or that you will start your own business and reach independence.

Namaste means “greetings to you”: “I acknowledge the highest aspect of you.” This card encourages you to use Namaste as a source of healing, spiritual growth, and reconciliation. Focusing on the act of this greeting establishes contact with the spiritual realm. It is easy to lose this connection throughout the day because life’s circumstances, events, emotions, and thoughts take your attention away from your spiritual presence. The expression of Namaste and the act of handshaking re-establishes contact again. “I see myself. I confirm the higher aspects of myself.” Apply these phrases when you meditate and even throughout the day. Greet the people that trigger you, blame you, or have wronged you. Use it when you have negative thoughts or when you find yourself judging others. Through Namaste, you are turning towards the higher aspects of these people, where they are free of guilt, ego, and bad intentions. “I see you. I am addressing the best version of you. When I look at you, I see a spiritual being.”

This card asks you not to underestimate the impact this could have on yourself and others. Namaste is also a grand gesture for practicing gratitude. It is essential to express appreciation for life. This also means greeting the ones you love and the ones you like and thanking them for being in your life. NAMASTE

## NO

This card suggests that now is not the time for action or initiating new energy, as the situation you’re facing hasn’t fully developed yet. Phases or projects may take longer than expected right now. The current direction of your thoughts and actions may not be in your best interest. Take a step back to reassess and examine the situation more closely. You might want to pull additional cards to clarify which aspects this “no” card is addressing. If you draw positive cards, don’t resist the good things coming your way—this card encourages you to break old patterns of resistance and self-sabotage. Be mindful of negative thinking.

If you’re asking about relationships or specific choices, this card is a clear and firm “no.” The circumstances are not favorable, or this path isn’t right for you. It may also be a sign that you need patience and a more positive outlook in a particular area.

## The key

To get through a locked door, you will need a key, which must be the correct one. This card may relate to an ongoing situation where you cannot find a solution. You might have suggested and tried several different approaches to no avail and now feel out of options. This card insists that there exists a key on your key chain that will fit. You just need to continue applying yourself and be persistent, now with the knowledge that you already possess the key. The solution is within reach. This card may also alert you to unused resources locked away in a cabinet. An examination of how you live your life can help enlighten you further. Take a closer look at your control mechanisms and become more open to a more accessible and humbler approach.

Lastly, this card may also represent a clever mind and extraordinary abilities. You have great mental capacity and can achieve whatever you set your mind to. You can even offer keys to others. You could become a teacher or an inspirational figure.

## Attention

Vigilance will provide the best results. There is immense freedom in developing a conscious presence, and this is the time for it. Do not let yourself be overwhelmed or controlled by brooding or thoughts that stem from past experiences. These concepts have brought emotional movement into your body, which in turn has invited a new nest of thoughts that lead to bodily manifestations. You have been giving time and energy to an unnecessary story. Feel yourself being awakened to realize that this takes your attention away from the present and weakens you from meeting others. 
               
Do not be afraid of silence during meetings or the quietness in your mind ahead of tasks or actions. This card advises you to allow the empty space, take a deep breath, and explore everything that's happening. Do this in situations where you might be too focused on cognitive control and fear of consequences. It is time to rediscover the beautiful connection that comes with being present. Take a step back and choose to be in the here and now. Trust the thoughts that arise when your mind is free and open. Get used to resting in silence often until impulses, thoughts, and readiness for action arise themselves. You will become skilled at listening in this way. You can trust that the information you receive is to your benefit. This can lead to eureka-moments and to furthering good and close relationships. Good luck!

## The Oracle

Your intuition is particularly strong right now, and you seem to effortlessly receive answers and insights. This card suggests that you have the potential to be an excellent advisor to others, as you have a keen ability to interpret energy with precision. Your words carry significant weight, and you are encouraged to trust in your psychic gifts, without fear of making mistakes.

Consider yourself an oracle, blessed with the ability to access valuable information and messages from the universe. It’s as if you have a direct line to a universal source where important wisdom are revealed. When you focus on specific people or events, this is where you can gather meaningful information. You may also have the capability to communicate with other dimensions or life forms.

If you resonate with this, work on enhancing this communication — it could be incredibly beneficial. Consider sharing your insights through a book or podcast. Additionally, this card may suggest that an oracle will soon provide answers to your questions. Use your intuition to find the right person to approach. If you’ve been skeptical about oracle cards, this card indicates that you may experience a breakthrough in understanding their value.

## Care

This card indicates that you can greatly benefit from others support, help, and care. The issue may centre on bodily imbalance, the need for physical reparation or adjustment, or care after a tiring phase of life. For some, a period of retreat is of great benefit. You need relief and rest. Search for harmony and well-being, towards something fragrant, something that gives you a feeling of sweetness. Create an oasis for yourself, filled with relaxation and tranquillity. Meeting your needs is at the centre of all this. Body and soul are your residence, and it is essential to look after it. Sometimes taking care of yourself means asking others for help. This may entail a good massage, a soothing conversation, herbs, vitamins, or a bodily review. Make a trip to the doctor’s, the health food store, or the pharmacy. Focusing on anything that can bring your body back to balance is important. Take care of yourself. 
               
This card may also indicate that you are overworked and in need of a holiday.",

## Pluto

This card represents potential transformation and powerful energies at play. You might be experiencing intense anger or finding yourself in a situation filled with escalating conflict. These issues could stem from long-standing provocations, power struggles, or overwhelming pressure, which might lead you to act in ways you'll later regret. 

Be aware that these powerful forces are in motion, making it difficult to remain calm. The card advises you to take a deep breath and accept your current circumstances without judgment or resistance. Instead of fighting against these energies or trying to control the situation, focus on handling the pressure with grace. 

There is a significant opportunity for growth and blessing, but also the potential for conflict and destruction. Embrace this period by working on deep breathing and acceptance. By reconciling with the inner pressure and surrendering to the process, you open yourself up to transformative expansion and growth.              

Additionally, this card may signify spiritual power and extraordinary abilities. You could find yourself in a position of influence or become the focus of admiration and respect from others.

## Trophy

Progress, happiness, and a pat on the shoulder. You are being recognized for your work, efforts, and courage. 
               
This card may indicate that you have been on a path filled with dips and challenges. It has taken its toll; you might have shed tears in secret and kept it all hidden from the outside. You may have experienced many dark moments and depressive periods but made it to the other side. Personal transformation and redemption are at the core of this card. Action and perseverance have made receiving this trophy possible. You have applied new knowledge, insight, and tools, and your reward has arrived. The trophy indicates that you have overcome something. You have come out on top. Or you will come out on top very soon. You have become a master in an area of your life and of your destiny. You may also have overcome your inner demons and limitations. Allow celebration for all it's worth and allow others to admire you. This is a well-earned victory card. Congratulations!

## Psychopath

Now is the time to break free from unhealthy dynamics. It's essential to distance yourself from toxic influences — represented by traits or individuals that undermine your self-worth and keep you in a state of denial. These negative forces, symbolized as the "psychopath" in this card, have drained your self-esteem, which you’ve allowed for too long.

There may be a shadow over your life because you’ve preferred to hide your own light. By focusing your energy on these toxic people, you've inadvertently nourished them, as they lack their own inner vitality. The solution is to reclaim your light and stand firmly in your own power. The time to act is now—there’s no need to wait any longer. Uplift yourself and move forward with purpose. Establish clear boundaries and disengage from all unhealthy relationships. During this transition, seek support from enlightened individuals who can guide you. Trust your intuition and turn inward if you face doubts. Everything will eventually align for you.

Additionally, this card advises you to avoid disruptive thoughts and focusing excessively on the faults of others. Be mindful of the energy you contribute to the collective field. If this resonates with you, ask for light and healing to restore balance.

## The Circle

This card relates to the protection of something valuable or the concept of allowing greater openness. You need to gain awareness of what you hold within and what you keep outside of your circle. You might decline entry to things that should be permitted into your inner core. You are now encouraged to open up more and make your interior more transparent. The circle is strong for you. When you open up to more light and energy from the outside, this will award you with beneficial flow and movement. It may loosen solidified attitudes and resolve ideas that need to be replaced. Meanwhile, you are also being supported in protecting your inner values and treasures. Be proud of them. Your boundaries are solid and sound.

This card may also indicate that practicing trust in an upcoming situation will become essential. You might have been skeptical and holding back in the past. However, this card indicates that the people concerned are of good standing and deserve your trust.

---

## The Rose

This card reminds you that you are part of a garden, where all people are represented with their personal flowers. Everybody has their own place and their own growth process. Everyone is unique. You must acknowledge yourself as a part of the community, but that still involves having the right to be visible. You need to be available to others but also able to set boundaries and speak up when someone is harsh with you. You have the right to flourish and, simultaneously, show that you have boundaries and defenses. All these qualities are a part of the rose, which symbolizes you and your place in the garden. You are a beautiful person with a gentle aura. A rose has thorns that others may prick themselves on if they are not sensitive and caring towards you. Do not apologize for it. 
               
This card is also a wake-up call for you if you have a tendency to take responsibility for other people’s actions. Allow your inner self to shine through while promising to take care of yourself and making your boundaries clearly known.

---

## The Forest

The forest represents the illusion of thoughts and attitudes. A message is currently being concealed and hidden from you. However, the issue at hand is, in reality, self-deception. The trees in the image can be perceived as an obstacle or barrier, and you may think the way forward is through a zigzag passage between all the trees. This is the illusion. There is another way; only when you give up your usual notion of reality will it reveal itself. This card indicates that you allow yourself to be stopped in a task because of stuck thought patterns and an old view of reality that holds you back. A new dimension is available and necessary to elevate you to a higher level of insight and knowledge. You have already made it so far that you can no longer deny this fact. It will also be important for positive changes, achievements, and the fulfillment of dreams. Look for signs and accept new impressions and impulses that come your way.

This card may also represent secrets. Explore other cards or pull more cards to get an indication of whether this could be beneficial to you or not. Someone may be keeping things hidden from you.

## The skyscraper

The skyscraper represents the many layers of consciousness. It has multiple floors and rooms where you can stow away your feelings, experiences, and other baggage. When you lock things away, forget them, or try to avoid these rooms, your imagination might start playing tricks on you. It can conjure trolls and ghosts in those rooms, and you may begin to fear those parts of yourself. This could activate anxiety and dread within you. You may not be far away from starting to worry about things in the real world that remind you of these. This card reveals that all the skyscraper floors must be visited often to be well lit. You need to know everything that is in each room and be familiar with all of them. Walk through all the floors of your mind. Sometimes it can be helpful to place a thought or an emotion on the third floor and then take the elevator to the tenth floor to achieve a greater overview. There is nothing wrong with this, but sooner or later, you have to go back and illuminate that floor again. Release the emotion. You must have access to every room in the skyscraper so that air and light can reach every corner. The circulation must be free, which only happens through inner work. Only then will you gain access to everything you need. Remember that you are the one holding the key that unlocks every room. 
           
This card encourages you to do inner work. Increase your self-awareness, and you will receive the answers you are searching for.

## Soon

News is on the way, and you won’t have to wait much longer. The surrounding cards in your reading can help you determine which area this news relates to. If this is a one-card reading, consider drawing additional cards for more insight. If you're hoping for something specific, this card suggests that things will likely turn out as you wish. If you're waiting for answers, they’re just around the corner. If you’ve been dealing with unclear circumstances or confusion, clarity is coming soon. 
               
If the situation involves an unsatisfying life circumstance, whether for you or someone you care about, this card indicates that positive change is on the horizon. Hold on to hope and be patient just a little longer.

## Sunshine

The sun symbolizes nourishment, energy, and warming light. In this card, the sun also represents visibility and recognition. You are entering a phase where the sunlight shines upon you. This will be a positive and remarkable period. You feel strong, vibrant, and full of extra abundance. The sun illuminates the things you are proud of; this will be a happy time for you. You will feel relief and be able to enjoy success. 
               
Some are especially lucky and can benefit from taking an added chance. This card means yes. Go for it!

---

## Grief

The card addresses your unresolved grief or indicates that you currently find yourself in a grieving life situation. Carrying grief is like leaving the plug in the bathtub; it will eventually overflow. Lingering in the tub also becomes uncomfortable; the water turns cold and eventually dirty. This is a stage of your life where you are being encouraged to take your grief seriously. If you currently carry suppressed grief and sorrow, you must allow yourself space to fully feel these emotions. You may be blocking the release of grief through self-pity or harsh thoughts of accusation and allegation. You could be thinking that the sorrow is at the wrong address and should be ejected as quickly as possible. You may be rehashing past events in your head, and telling yourself that the pain is inflicted on you here and now. This card asks you to experience the sorrow without shielding yourself, struggling, and entirely without attack and defense. Allowing the grief will release a lot of stress and pain you can finally be free from. Sudden and beneficial moments of transformation may arise and fuel your development. It can also disintegrate your veils, fears, and confusion.
               
This card may also represent a painful period in your life that will soon pass.

## The Statue

A statue, a book, or a place of power may become meaningful to you. However, the item is not something you need to own, and the location is not one you must visit. It is all on the energy plane: Visualize the statue, book, or place. This card indicates that you possess a valuable link that could release qualities within you which have been unreachable until now. You can reactivate talents from previous lives, or earlier phases of this life, that you mastered excellently and that you now need to find back to. You may need help overcoming a threshold so you can move on, or you might have to confront a specific situation you are currently facing. The issue at hand may also be a long-standing struggle where you have asked for assistance and help, or you have a wish to elevate your own attributes. This card indicates that this connection can become a valuable aid in your life and strengthen you on many levels. Use your intuition, and the answer will come to you. Good luck!

---

## Stand-In

This card refers to a stand-in that will relieve you for a while. You need help. Leaving some of the workloads to others is crucial to the final result. This is purely a positive thing, and the stand-in will do an even better job than you would have been able to at this time. Don’t worry; this person will not take credit for your projects, creations, or your own work. The important thing here is for you to become passive for a short time or shift your use of energy from one area over to another. You may need to centre your focus on just one thing and leave the rest to others. This card is a weak yes. If you have thought about taking two steps back, do it!

---

## The Star

This is a card of victory that appears to you because you deserve it. It represents a person that will become more visible and light up the scene of life. You will become capable of reaching out through the many layers of obstacles holding you back for a long time. The issues may be life experiences, poor circumstances, environments, or people. These layers might have been represented by incorrect thoughts and attitudes or just karma. You may have been feeling trapped and believing that life was going against you, and as a result, you have suffered from fear and unhappiness. Finally, this time has passed, and you will soon feel great relief. Life will ensure that you receive your just reward. In the future, you will be visible and show the way, like a star on earth. You will spread light and share valuable information and experiences. This card can also represent good news and may inform of upcoming success in specific cases and issues. The outcome will be in your favor.

---

## The Cliff

This card reveals that you are facing a situation that may be challenging. Things are now all up to your own agility and maneuverability; you have complete control over this situation. It is about a kind of crossroads and necessary change. This card is not referring to painful events ahead of you, nor any that will harm you — add more cards if you wish to calm yourself. Nevertheless, you are being encouraged to be brave and make decisions now. You must take steps forward, despite knowing how far down you could fall. To move on in life and free the resources needed for change, you have to take these chances. You might need to start seeing things in a new light. Everyone will find themselves on the edge of a cliff at some point in their lives, but not everyone will realize it at the moment because their senses have dulled. When you remain awake and aware, you have all the requirements for flexibility and landing safely on your feet. You are ready for a change.

---

## Sponge

This card indicates a sensitive nature and that you, with ease, can take responsibility for that which occurs in the shared space. You can perceive attitudes and subconscious aspects of others and read energy formations. You quickly identify others’ tones of voice, posture, and the unspoken words between the lines. This card warns you against becoming a sponge, against soaking up other people’s energy and problems. Even if you feel the need to help and heal, it will cause confusion and could instead linger with you, becoming your own baggage. If you wish to use your abilities, you should instead send the energy you pick up towards the light or help the person deal with their issues themselves. You should not take responsibility and let it become a part of your. Just as sponges soak up written words and sentences on a blackboard, you can absorb the shared collective’s accumulation of opinions, attitudes, pains, and fears. Be clear about your boundaries. This also applies to the space between you and others. This is a no-card. It represents unfortunate responsibility. There is great danger of you becoming weighed down and invaded, so seek refuge and practice good techniques. Squeeze everything out of the sponge and let it dry in the sun for a while.

---

## Test

You will be tested to evaluate what you have learned, and it is for your own good. The universe checks what holds water and whether you are ready to receive new and incredible blessings. When life rewards you like this, you must ensure you have the space to obtain and use them well. Do you want to use the gifts in the best way, or will you sabotage and throw them away? A test is not a punishment, nor can it be classified as opposition. You are being tested on how you utilize your tools and what you have gotten out of life. How responsible are you for yourself, and can you adjust and accommodate challenging emotions when situations require you to? If you become unbalanced by feelings of powerlessness, it is crucial to strengthen your endurance and confidence. This is a period when you are being tested on insight and growth. Become curious about even the lessons you have already learned and be willing to improve and adjust!

This card can also relate to actual tests or exams in your work or studies. You may be challenged by something or someone. Lastly, the card can refer to a creative person or an investor. This person is concerned with improvements and works to develop new products or knowledge.

## The Train

Take a chance, hop on the train, and see where it takes you. Sometimes you can get so caught up in thoughts, plans, routes, and schedules that you do not even board one: You miss the train entirely. You find yourself perplexed, running around in circles before having to go back to the timetable and search for a new train. This card encourages you to be disciplined and not waste time on over-excitement. Stop being hung up on plans, schedules, and places. You may be sabotaging things with your actions by trying to predict their outcomes or asking too many questions. You could also be doubting your own worth and what you deserve. Start trusting your intuition more. Conditions are favorable, and this particular train will take you to your desired station. 
               
This card may also hint at synchronous events that will give you new opportunities and chances that you should seize. Act now!

---

## Patience

It will take time before things work out the way you want them to. Conditions may be unfavorable right now or you may encounter obstacles in the road by acting now. Your endurance may be tested. Answers will also not arrive as expected and could take longer than planned. The reasons behind this may be human-caused or the passage of time. You might never get any explanation for why and never fully understand. This card encourages you to practice patience. All this could also be a test of your inner character. 
           
Luck and success in your life does not rely on these answers or what you are waiting for. Everything will happen when it happens. Rest easy, find comfort in knowing this, and choose to trust in the process. Use this opportunity to practice patience so that it may cement itself within you and become fully integrated.",

## Herbal Medicine

Herbs will be your ally right now. You need extra support and strength to navigate life’s challenges. Herbs can uplift your energy and mood, helping you to see things from a more positive perspective. The situation you're facing may be encouraging a much-needed cleansing process to rid your body of toxins and impurities. Herbs can fortify your immune system and promote the health of your organs.

Incorporate herbs into your daily routine — drink herbal teas, moisturize your skin with herbal oils, and add herbs to your meals for added benefits. You might also consider exploring dietary supplements that align with your needs. This card may also suggest that you have a natural interest in herbs and all things that grow. Embrace this passion; investing more time and energy into it will bring you great rewards.

---

## The View

When standing on the top of a mountain, and the view is clear, you can see much further than before. The view may even be breathtaking. People ascend to the top of the mountain just to reach this view. However, they also climb to attain that unique experience and the gain of having labored for something. This card indicates a new insight that will give you a greater overview. With it comes harmony, a feeling of victory, and mastery. You may experience achieving a kind of control in life, which is positive and long-awaited. You will truly see all that you have accomplished. You will become aware of the fruits of your labour, which will give you a real feeling of security and satisfaction. This is something you have not seen before. You may have doubted yourself and your aspirations and often wondered what the point is. Now is the time for you to peek through the cloud cover of inner confusion and start viewing things from above. Everything you have accomplished will become apparent. Be proud of yourself.

This card may also indicate that you must look at things from above before making a decision. Do not rush. Investigate more before interpreting and defining other people.

---

## The Road

This card asks you to keep your attention on the road. Imagine yourself sitting in the driver's seat of a car: You keep your eyes on the road and do not look out towards the sides. You do not want to risk crashing into anyone or driving into a ditch. Even if you are tempted to look away, and towards the fields ahead because important things may be happening there, it is a derailment that does not benefit you. The exact same thing is true about your mind. Keep your attention on what you are doing at the moment, and do not allow yourself to be controlled by random thoughts or old stories that might resurface. Contemplation and pondering only drain you of power and may lead to internal doubt and stress. Sometimes you may convince yourself there is something to be gained by lingering in thoughts, and that you can figure things out there. However, in that case, it is crucial to have willpower and discipline so that you can stop yourself. Being focused on your tasks, your work, or preparing for new projects is a lot more advantageous to you. This card encourages you to focus on your desired results and not give in to the unnecessary internal dialogue.

---

## Success

A situation or phase will have a happy ending. Or a demanding and time-consuming process will have a successful outcome. This card is a clear yes. Drawing this card means that things will go your way in the topic at hand and that the outcome will harmonize with your objectives. You have had good intentions and will achieve a lucky result. 
           
You may also gain increased income, winnings in games, or achieve other forms of victories that trigger feelings of joy and happiness. The events in question may arrive now or in the near future.",

---

## Blessings

Grace is stepping in to lift you out of a difficult situation. You are being showered with blessings, and luck is coming your way, even if you feel undeserving. This card reminds you that, in the eyes of grace, you are always worthy of good things.

While the law of cause and effect, the law of attraction, and karma might suggest otherwise, grace doesn’t follow those rules. You may be stuck in negative thinking, self-pity, or acting against your better judgment, perhaps driven by fear, discontent, or disapproval. You may have been investing in low vibrations, yet grace still enters your life, filling it with light, high energy, blessings, and gifts.

This can happen to anyone, regardless of their circumstances. Life is intelligent and cares about your well-being. Someone is watching over you—yes, you specifically—and is offering you a helping hand. You are being lifted above the dualities of earthly existence and can rest safely in this grace for a while. Accept and enjoy this divine assistance.

---

## The Witness

You currently find yourself in a situation where you are looking for answers and alternating between right and left. You are weighing options against each other and examining the degree of emotions and the probability of outcomes. Loss and fear are compared with courage and gain. Which choice will guarantee you your desired result? This card encourages you to focus on the silent part of yourself, which does not emotionally identify with events or outcomes in your life. The witness is neutral and unaffected. This voice within you holds no strong opinions and only speaks through an inner knowledge that does not distinguish between right and wrong. The witness within you can only say one thing, and this is the answer you need to listen to. In this situation, there is only one correct answer: go to the witness.

## The alternative Brain

Do you find yourself self-sabotaging when things are going well? Do you take the blame when bad things happen? Do you struggle to make choices that align with your own needs and desires? Perhaps when you're with others, you often think, “How should I behave to be accepted and avoid upsetting anyone?”

This card warns against a mindset that supports the scapegoat role or feelings of inferiority. The scapegoat carries the weight of blame and suppresses the authentic self, making it feel as though your true feelings and desires don’t have the right to exist. Thoughts and actions stemming from this mindset can lead to significant suffering.

This card encourages you to look within and see if you’ve internalized this way of thinking. If you have, remember that you are not a scapegoat and that you have the same inherent value as everyone else. Starting today, work on eliminating actions and thoughts that come from this place. Be kind to yourself, give yourself the freedom to fail, and start surprising both yourself and others. It’s time to nurture your authentic self – the part of you that is true and knows what you really need. Take time to consider your needs. Make it your primary focus to understand and honor them. You are the most important person in your life, and you have immense value. Today is the day to begin acting in accordance with your true self and your needs.

EXERCISE:
For the foreseeable future, focus on the following questions when you’re around others:

What do I want?
What is my opinion?
What do I feel right now?
What do I need?
You might find it helpful to write these questions on small note cards and keep them with you. This will help you practice listening to your true desires and inner guidance. This is the greatest gift you can give yourself.

## Breaking a Cycle

This card encourages you to break the cycle of negative self-talk. Inner dialogues that undermine and demotivate you only lead to negative emotions and must be consciously stopped. Such patterns can lead to feelings of powerlessness and despair, further eroding your trust in life. For example, you might think, “I’m always the cause of quarrels and conflicts. It’s better for me to suffer so others don’t have to. Everything is my fault! There must be something wrong with me because my needs don’t matter.”

Can you feel how these thoughts drain your energy? Can you see that these attitudes are making you weak? This card urges you to break free from this negative cycle, starting right now. Starting today!

EXERCISE:
Say aloud: “I take responsibility for my own feelings and actions, and allow others to take responsibility for theirs. I bring harmony and joy into others’ lives and receive the same in return. I deserve happiness and joy, and I am entitled to fulfill my desires and needs. I am valuable.”

Feel your worth. Let these affirmations sink deep within you. See through the lies, and allow your power and confidence to blossom. Trust that life will support you as you take steps toward becoming your true self.

## The Golden Card

Do you find yourself in situations where you're treated poorly, or where you consistently end up with the short end of the stick? Reflect on these moments—perhaps you feel ignored, mistrusted, or struggle to find your place in a group. Maybe you’ve been unjustly ridiculed or spoken to in a condescending manner. What exactly do you say and do in these situations? What thoughts cross your mind about yourself and others? Take some time to explore these patterns, and consider writing down what you discover.
 
 The golden card you’ve drawn today encourages you to start doing the opposite of what you usually do. Challenge yourself to think and act differently in these scenarios. Notice how things might begin to shift—how you feel, how others respond, and how situations that were once difficult may start to change.
 
 Remember, when you like yourself and clearly define your boundaries, others are more likely to respect and reflect that. With experience and practice in applying the wisdom of this golden card, you’ll start to heal and naturally live from a stable, empowered place within yourself.

## The Inner Child

Inside everyone is an inner child — a sensitive, receptive part of you that carries the imprints of your childhood experiences. The emotions and impulses that were not fully felt or processed when you were young contribute to this child’s state of stress and are actually forming the foundation of your inner being. When you turn inward and detach from the distractions of the outside world, you encounter this child. It’s the energy of this inner child that often causes internal disturbances.

One of life’s greatest wonders occurs when the needs of your inner child are met. When the emotions that have been held back for so many years are finally allowed to flow freely through your body and mind- It allow true peace and quiet to emerge within you. This is where real magic happens — bringing harmony and healing into your life. You already hold the key to this transformation. By allowing and acknowledging your inner child, you can invite release and joy into your body, mind and soul.

EXERCISE:
Imagine your inner child floating in a dark room. Picture yourself gently catching it in your arms, embracing the child with care. Promise that you will take care of it and never let it float alone in the dark again. Look at the child’s face, accepting all the expressions you see. Tell the child that it is allowed to feel all its emotions and that you will love it unconditionally.

## The Weak Link

Do you often feel worse about yourself when you’re around certain people? This card suggests that you might be spending your energy on supporting people who aren’t good for you. You may be giving away your power, playing the role of the weak link, putting others on a pedestal, or allowing yourself to be diminished or mistreated. This card encourages you to break free from this habit and claim a stronger, more empowered position in your life. Stand firm and treat yourself as an equal when interacting with others. Even if fear arises, don’t back down — endure it. Push through the discomfort and shame that might come with valuing yourself. Stand up for yourself every day. Over time, the shame and discomfort will fade, and a natural sense of self-worth will emerge. Trust that your perseverance, honesty, and bravery will bring the reward you deserve.

EXERCISE:
Keep a piece of thick rope nearby as a symbol of your strength. Every time you see it, remind yourself that your time as the weak link is over. You are strong and unbreakable.

## Your Best Life

Create a short list of your core values. If you’re unsure what they are, start by making a list of things you think you value. Then, go through each item, paying attention to how it resonates in your body. Anything that warms you or expands your heart a little more belongs on your list. Another approach is to consider who and what inspires true admiration and longing in you. These qualities likely reflect values that you hold within yourself. You are stepping into your best life, and as you move forward, life will reflect the values you cherish. Trust this process.

EXERCISE:
Place a note on your bathroom mirror with the following affirmation: “I deserve to be who I am and to radiate all that I am. I value myself highly, and I am equal to all other people. My inner self knows what is true for me, and my emotions communicate this truth. My values and I are one.”

## Dreams

This card serves as a reminder of the immense value of your dreams. Reflect on what fascinates you most in the world, and allow your imagination to transport you there—see yourself becoming a part of it. Dreams are possibilities waiting to be realized! They reveal the depth of your potential and, with time and effort, can blossom into reality. What do you see around you that you admire and wish to incorporate into your life? Dedicate time each day to let your thoughts drift into dreamland, and savor the experience of being there. Envision your dreams as already true, and let those feelings fill you. Your brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, so immerse yourself fully in these visions. Let them expand, knowing that the sky's the limit.

Now is the time to take a leap of faith and explore what you can become. Your potential deserves to shine, and you are worthy of flourishing. You are deserving of so much more!

EXERCISE:
Create a vision board. Start with a large, blank canvas, and fill it with images, words, and drawings that represent your dreams. Keep this powerful “image” in a place where you can see it often, as a constant reminder of what you can achieve and what awaits you!

## Self-love

This card is a gentle reminder of the importance of showing yourself love and care to welcome good things into your life. Love helps us relax, feel content, and find joy in what life offers. When you embrace love, the best emotions flow through your body, and your mind responds with peaceful, happy thoughts—or simply with a sense of calm. If you’ve carried guilt or shame, you may have felt that love was scarce or that you weren’t truly loved. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. You are loved, and you deserve love! Life is eager to shower you with its most precious gifts. You are awake, valuable, and lovable.

To receive the good things life has in store, you must also give yourself an abundance of love. Cultivate an open and accepting attitude, where love feels welcome and fills you up completely.

EXERCISE:
Take a deep breath four times. With each breath, affirm to yourself:
“I love myself. I love everything about who I am. I am valuable and important. The best relationship I have is the one with myself."

## A Lifelong Role

This card brings attention to the risk of becoming a scapegoat or a punching bag in your relationships. You may find yourself taking the lowest position, allowing others to diminish your self-worth. You might feel overlooked, disregarded, or even targeted with negativity. Perhaps you sense that someone resents the good things in your life, or you feel misrepresented in front of others. In some ways, accepting this treatment might stem from believing that you don’t deserve better.

It’s crucial to recognize this pattern and protect yourself by setting firm boundaries. Now is the time to cultivate positive thoughts about yourself and to remember that you deserve far more than you’ve allowed. You have the right to be treated with respect and dignity.

EXERCISE:
Visualize yourself standing face-to-face with the person who has treated you as a scapegoat or punching bag. Tell them that you are stepping away from this role and that you expect to be accepted and respected for who you truly are. Assert that respect and dignity are non-negotiable for any continued relationship. Extend your hand and imagine whether they choose to take it. Repeat this exercise several times, giving yourself the time to fully embrace this process. As you do, notice how the dynamic changes — either they will treat you differently, or they may fade from your life. Don’t be afraid to let go of relationships that cause you harm.

---

## Acknowledgment

This card is a reminder that pain lingers when we ignore or fail to acknowledge certain truths. When you open yourself up to recognition and acceptance, the barriers that turn pain into suffering begin to dissolve. By acknowledging the truth, you allow the pain to be exposed and released, guided by the courage to see things as they truly are. Feel your pain, sit with your emotions, and notice how light breaks through, like the first rays of a sunrise. Your story deserves to be seen and understood.

You don’t need to shout it from the rooftops, but you must recognize it. Dare to speak your truth aloud to yourself. It may be about your childhood, or about experiences you’ve endured. Embracing this truth might lead to changes that feel challenging and uncomfortable, especially if you’re not used to prioritizing your true needs. Others may question you, but that doesn’t matter. This is your life, and you are entitled to your own story and to ensuring your real needs are met. Be faithful to your truth, and from this point forward, everything will begin to enrich your life.

EXERCISE:
Give yourself a gift that symbolizes your acknowledgment that you deserve more than you have allowed yourself to receive. It’s time to embrace the abundance life has to offer. This gift could be a piece of jewelry, a picture, or a small ornament. Let it serve as a reminder that good things are now flowing toward you.

## The Movie

This card encourages you to tell the story of your life, primarily to yourself. Reflect on the little two-year-old you once were. Picture yourself stumbling along, looking up at the big adults around you. Feel what your small body felt. Who were you at five years old? What did you look like? What emotions are captured in that little face? See yourself going to school. What were your days like? What occupied your thoughts? As you grew older, becoming bigger and more independent, how did you perceive yourself?

Take your time with this. Accept whatever comes up — whether it’s a lot, a little, or even nothing at all. Do any specific experiences stand out? Is there anything that makes you flinch? Acknowledge every impression and memory that emerges. Remember that these experiences were lived by a real person — by you. Trace your journey up to today. How did you feel yesterday? Who was around you? Acknowledge all the experiences you've had on a deep level.

EXERCISE:
Begin keeping a journal of the present. Create space for your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, making them meaningful and true. Write them down on a beautiful piece of paper. Record your views, opinions, and perspectives. You can also capture memories from previous years, or moments from your childhood that come to mind. Give your story space in this journal — every detail that holds meaning and value. Remember, you have value.

## Transformation

A deep and liberating process may be unfolding within you. Breakthroughs and transformations often come with painful pressure and chaotic emotions that are easy to resist. However, this time you are being guided to choose non-action — withdrawal and observation, rather than reacting or seeking distraction. Allow yourself to withstand the pressure and emotions without trying to escape them. The wheel may be slowing down; don’t spin it further. Trust in the process, even if immediate results are not visible, and take a leap of faith.

This card encourages you to dare to withdraw right now. If old thought patterns begins to tempt you, remember that those thoughts do not tell the truth. Instead, relax, observe, and practice silent acceptance and vigilance. Embrace your emotions as you would embrace a child — with gentle compassion.

This phase requires great endurance. Patience and discipline are needed to resist acting on the difficult emotions that arise. But understand that this is happening now because you are ready. So much good is in store for you. Soon, you will enjoy a natural sense of power and confidence, nourished by your own overflowing positive resources.

EXERCISE:
Affirm and keep these words close to your heart: “I am on my way to becoming a truly free human being."

## Bird Song

Here’s a revised version of your text:

This card brings encouragement and good news. The victory it symbolizes comes from fresh, new thoughts emerging from your truest, healthiest self. You’re beginning to think like yourself again — one thought at a time. Each one is valuable. Listen to the birdsong outside; take a moment to really tune in. The birds sing effortlessly, sharing a beautiful melody that life offers, fully participating in the world. You, too, have your own voice, your own power and unique color to contribute to life.

Pay attention to the sensations that arise within you and act on them. In this case, the small things are significant. Then, let your imagination run wild—find creative pursuits that express who you are and what your voice, your song, has to share.

Allow yourself to enjoy what you do. Play with everything that comes through you, and toss the critical voice out the window! Life is so rich, with magic shining from the green grass in spring, and sunlight throwing an enchanting celebration in the garden. You are just as magical. Begin to see yourself with caring, generous eyes, and nurture the creation that is you. This will gradually become easy, natural, and essential. It’s an absolute must! You’ll also see that everyone else is equally magical at their core, and you’ll seek out those who recognize this and want to share it with you. There’s a celebration on the horizon — congratulations!

## Go Deeper

When emotions feel unbearable, it’s not the intensity of the pain itself, but rather one or more of the following factors:

1. The thoughts and stories that accompany the painful emotions create a relentless itch, intensifying the pain through chaotic thinking and resistance.
2. While consciously you may want to release the pain, on an unconscious level, you might be identifying with it, holding on rather than letting it go.
3. You may be resisting the emotions, rejecting them instead of accepting them.

               This card encourages you to identify which of these reasons apply to you and take steps to approach your pain in a new, healing way:

1. Observe the thoughts and stories that arise, but refrain from engaging with them. Practice surrender by focusing on the core feeling without getting lost in the mental narrative.
2. If you find that you’re identifying with your pain, acknowledge this to yourself and consciously decide to let it go. Affirm: “I release everything back to its source. I keep what serves me well. I am free.”
3. When the pain is linked to resistance or rejection, work on acceptance. Affirm: “I allow everything to come to light. I’m permitted to feel what I feel, and I will allow the pain to be fully experienced. I trust in life.”

               By consistently choosing to approach your emotions in this way, they will no longer be overwhelming. Instead, they will become a source of strength and a guide for self-care and authentic living. Good luck!

## Healing Orientation

This card suggests that you may be grappling with anger and sorrow stemming from recurring feelings of inferiority and oppression. You might feel a strong urge for justice and order, and perhaps find yourself attributing blame to specific people or situations. You are being advised to not act on these impulses. It will take some time to sort out these emotions, healing and processing it all, and to finally frame them in a comprehensible light. During this period you may encounter self-sabotaging thought patterns.

               If you launch a crusade against certain people or let bitterness seep into your interactions, you’ll only end up harming yourself. Your primary focus should be on self-healing and nurturing your inner potential. Start by establishing natural boundaries with people and situations. Place yourself in environments that are healthy and safe. This might require standing firm when someone crosses your boundaries, but the most crucial aspect is orienting yourself toward healing. This process will involve confronting painful emotions, allowing yourself to fully experience them, and ultimately accepting them. This is where true transformation begins. The person you are at your core — open, free, and secure in your being—will begin to shine through. Feeling naturally confident and safe, trusting your inner guidance, and expressing your emotions mwill be new life experiences for you, and will bring about many moments of genuine joy and deep relief.

               EXERCISE:
Treat yourself to a bouquet of flowers today as a gesture of self-support!

## The Laser Beam

Do you realize that an iron will resides within you, ready to benefit your life? Sometimes, we might use this will in ways that make life more difficult, allowing our stubbornness to block the gentle breeze that could offer relief. This card encourages you to recognize the power you have over your own life. The laser-like focus within you has the strength to cut through the attitudes and patterns you've held onto for too long. You possess the ability to clear away anything that no longer serves you. Imagine this laser beam as an inner force that radiates throughout your body, illuminating and protecting you. This centering energy reminds you to stay focused on positive, self-nurturing thoughts as you navigate the releasing processes you’re going through. Be loyal and generous with yourself during this time.

EXERCISE:

If possible, find yourself a quartz crystal, preferably an oblong one with a distinct tip. Let this powerful stone symbolize the laser beam within you. Quartz crystals are known for their ability to purify and protect against negative energy and falsehoods. Hold the crystal in your hand and affirm: "My inner power is a laser beam that cuts through illusions and awakens me."

## The Painting

This card invites you to paint a color portrait of yourself. This creative process will help support and strengthen your journey of becoming who you truly are. By painting a color portrait, you can discover and connect with the colors that represent you, revealing more of what lies within. Expect to be surprised! What kind of strokes will express the power within you? What shapes and forms will convey your unique talents? Which color palettes capture your emotions and the feelings that need to be expressed?

An intuitive painting can reveal much about yourself and offer new insights. You are a unique individual, with your own frequencies and path to walk. Just as others have their own beautiful inner paintings, so do you. You are beautiful and deserve to be seen. The time has come to explore your inner painting and bring it to light.

EXERCISE:

Gather a canvas and paints that resonate with you. Set aside ample time and create a space where you can immerse yourself in this exercise. You might not complete your color portrait in one day—it could take weeks or even months. There are no rules; you have complete freedom to create and express yourself. Enjoy the process. Good luck!

## Victim Of Bullying

Are you accustomed to feeling guilty and being unnoticed in your pain? Do you feel like you struggles with bullying or mistreatment and this go unseen? Perhaps you believe you are a burden, demanding more than you deserve.

               This card urges you to recognize and honor the truth within your body and emotions. You are being invited to see the truth. Take a deep breath and fully connect with what you’re feeling. Are you giving yourself permission to experience and express your emotions? If you’re being hurt or bullied, it’s crucial to acknowledge your pain and reject any misplaced guilt. You do not deserve to be mistreated, and if you think you do, it’s because of a false belief imposed on you. Bring this lie into the light and dispel it.

               Understand that there is nothing wrong with you. You have every right to exist, to occupy space, and to be yourself, fully and authentically. You are entitled to your own reactions and should never accept bullying. Embrace and nurture yourself and allow your inner child to surface and take its place in your life. Both life and other people that radiate harmony will help you. You are not alone, but your own awareness will be your greatest ally.

               EXERCISE:
Find a tree and create a small sanctuary for yourself and your inner child. Allow yourself to find comfort and peace in this space. Talk to your inner child and the tree. Embrace the magic of life and the support available to you. Release any preconceived notions about what is or isn’t possible. The tree is alive! Your inner child is alive! Let yourself be surprised and go with the flow. Good luck!

## Darkness Before Dawn

The darkest part of the night comes just before dawn. The phase before emotional and spiritual transformation works in a very similar way; things often get worse before they get better. It may feel like a long, unending darkness, where it’s hard to believe that relief is near. There’s no guarantee of immediate change; everything hinges on the choices you make. Will you choose trust or mistrust? Will you commit to perseverance or give in to restlessness? Surrender or resist? Sometimes the easiest thing is to skip the choice altogether, and to just sleep through the night. That, however, only leads to postponing the issue, because being awake is a prerequisite for transformation. There are no shortcuts. This card reminds you that trust, perseverance, and surrender are the only paths to bring light to a dark situation.

               It also reassures you that you already possess the courage needed to navigate this challenging time. These qualities within you will grow stronger and become invaluable tools in your journey. Resist the urge to dwell on thoughts that fuel anxiety and resistance, even if they seem justified. Instead, nourish yourself and allow the process to unfold in its own time. Be dedicated and brave. Sooner or later, the light within you will emerge, and once it does, nothing will be able to extinguish the flame inside you.

## New Horizons

If you’ve faced many disappointments, grief, and betrayal, it’s essential to balance these experiences with the good things that bring you joy and fulfillment. How do you do that? By using your inner strength to seek out and protect the moments and experiences that uplift you. Focus on finding that positive feeling. Notice how life expands and cares for you, leaving small pearls of happiness along your path for you to discover. When you recognize the richness of life, you become protected and set free, cultivating a deep sense of gratitude.

You don’t have to respond to abuse and betrayal with negativity — whether it’s condemnation, thoughts of revenge, ill wishes, fear, or dwelling on past wounds. This card of new horizons suggests that within you lies a golden place, a source of higher wisdom and understanding, including insights into your role in the bigger picture. Even if your everyday consciousness can’t always grasp it, everything that happens to us carries a deeper meaning. But more importantly, by finding this golden place within, you open yourself to new horizons filled with growth, success, love, abundance, and triumph. These rewards naturally flow to you as you stand firmly in yourself, grounded in the fertile soil of self-nourishment. Life will mirror back the beauty and joy you cultivate within. Trust in this truth.

EXERCISE:

Take some time today to reflect on this. Allow yourself to fully accept your life and sink into trust and new understanding. Gradually, you will realize that this is the greatest form of self-love.

## New Life

Innocence is born from true inner security, serving as a state that will protect and uplift you. This isn’t the old naivety that once sacrificed its needs, fooled into believing it didn’t deserve better. This card signifies that a new chapter has begun — one where you can embrace innocence in your authentic self, without the vulnerability of being easily misled. You now live with wisdom, drawing from years of experience and insight. There is so much joy ahead for you — a genuine life filled with real emotions that are entirely yours. Whether your feelings are heavy like grey skies, turbulent like a windswept ocean, or warm and gentle like a summer’s day, what matters is that you own them fully and make space for them all. Every emotion is energy moving through your life and body. Be grateful for being so alive, for having the capacity to feel so deeply. Living the good life means embracing all of it — naturally, easily, and fully. Can you see how anxiety arises when you resist your emotions? When your thoughts build walls that activate fear and dread toward something as natural as a feeling? Life, in truth, is simple. It’s rich and generous, and when you flow with it, you will be richly rewarded.

EXERCISE:

Say these words out loud:
“Yes, please. I want to live fully and love all of my emotions. I accept that life is a mix of everything. I live and create my life every single moment."

## Right Fertiliser

Imagine your inner self as a patch of land. Up until now, you may have unknowingly poured poison into the soil, thinking it was fertiliser. The labels were deceiving, convincing you that these toxic elements were good for you. But now, it’s time to turn things around. Recognize that nothing good can grow from tainted soil. It’s time to replace those harmful substances with the richest, most nourishing ingredients: love, thoughtfulness, generosity, kindness, trust, and brilliant clarity. Embrace the belief that you deserve good things and that blessings can now flow your way. By choosing healthy thoughts and habits, you can rejoice in being yourself and wish the same for others.

What do you think will happen when all these positive elements enrich your soil? Write a list of what will now grow from this fertile ground. The “fertiliser” in your life consists of anything that fills you with health, power, and joy — these are the things you need to cultivate around you. While there will still be parts of your life that require work, responsibility, struggle, and sacrifice, remember that when you are rooted in healthy soil, you can handle these challenges in new ways. You may feel tired, but it will be a good kind of tiredness, easily restored by rest or a short break — these are not the symptoms of a toxic environment. Prepare yourself for a whole new way of living.

Keep these words in your heart: “I am my own loving friend. I think lovingly about who I am and wish only the best for myself and others.”

## Sabotage

This card suggests that you may be unknowingly sabotaging your own opportunities, growth, and healthy relationships. You might be resisting positive experiences through negative thoughts and expectations, or even feeling physical discomfort when things go well. It’s important to recognize this self-sabotage as soon as possible, so you can disarm it. Stop giving power to these thoughts and tendencies. Stay mindful and alert, making it easier to correct yourself when you begin to undermine your own happiness.
               
               When you notice self-sabotage creeping in, place your hand on your heart and affirm: "I am what is in my heart. I am valuable, significant, and deserving of good things. I accept and love myself." Afterward, make a commitment to never judge yourself for self-sabotaging. Be gentle and understanding with yourself. There are underlying reasons why you may feel undeserving of good things, and it takes time to heal from whatever has caused this behavior. Meanwhile, offer yourself positive and supportive affirmations each day.
               
               Here are some examples:
               
               "I am valuable and significant."
               "I deserve to be happy and well."
               "I deserve to blossom into my full potential."
               "I am always welcome."

## Self-Punishment

This card highlights a uncomfortable self-punishment you might be inflicting upon yourself. You may feel overwhelmed by obsessive thoughts, trapping you in a corner. Thoughts of death might even seem easier to manage than life itself. If this resonates with you, it's crucial to prioritize taking a break and creating a space for healing and relief. You can start right here, right now. Instead of judging yourself for your thoughts, give yourself credit for seeking self-help. It's also important to reach out for support from others. Remember, when emotional pressures build and your suffering feels unbearable, it often signals that redemption and healing are near. These painful moments are invitations to surrender.

EXERCISE:
Take a moment to focus on your body. Imagine a soft, white light filling you from head to toe, flowing into every cell and thought, bringing relief and comfort. Now, picture an angel with great compassion, spreading its wings and embracing you, allowing you to let go and relax. Rest in this embrace for as long as you need. If it helps, you can carry the angel with you, inside you, as you move forward — reminding yourself of your worth, and your right to good nurture and care. Allow this sense of relief to sink in, and take four deep, calming breaths.

## Shame

This is the most painful card in the deck. Shame is a profound feeling of worthlessness, a sense that the person you are has no value or rights. If you were often told to be ashamed of yourself as a child, you may have internalized this shame as a barrier to genuine emotion and self-care. Inner shame can feel like an internal enemy, threatening you and becoming a weapon of self-sabotage and self-destruction. This can lead to severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive thoughts. The most devastating consequence for a shame-filled child is being robbed of the natural self-esteem and self-love that would have flourished without that shame. It undermines the inner security that lays the foundation for growth, blossoming, and a good life. Such a child may reject their true self and instead choose to wear masks, feeling that their authentic self is a threatening abyss. As an adult, this shame may simmer beneath the surface, preventing you from helping yourself and breaking free from negative patterns and false identities.

Intertwined with the painful feeling of shame is a critical inner voice that tells you you’re worthless and that your life will never improve. This is where deep despair resides — over lost years and missed opportunities to experience and live as your true self. Shame is the heaviest emotion you can carry. But take heart, because this card also reveals a victory. If you feel that shame plays a significant role in your self-improvement journey, it’s a sign that you’re doing the right things. You are on the right path! You are now making choices that align with who you truly are. You are on your way home.

If you find yourself in this phase, please persevere. Seek support and relief, and make life as pleasant as possible for yourself. Facing your own shame head-on is tough because it often means letting go of your false self, your defense mechanisms, and coping strategies. You need to confront your shame without hiding from it and continue moving forward with trust, even if it feels like everything is collapsing. It’s worth it! Hang in there. On the other side of this struggle is goodness, stability, and life — your true self. Shame has kept you hidden for all these years.

Imagine yourself as a tiny ladybug caught in a heavy rainstorm. The ground becomes muddy and unstable, and you lose your footing. It’s a difficult place to be. But remember, the sun always comes out, and the ground will solidify again. You can trust in the foundation of life. Soon, new life will emerge—fresh, green, and lush. Trust in that. Everything will work out for you, precious one.

## Guilt

This card is telling you: It is not your fault.

When something is wrong with someone — if they feel unwell, act strangely, or differently — it is not your fault. It’s not because of anything you’ve done, something they’ve heard about you, or because they’ve decided you are a bad person. How someone else behaves belongs to them, not to you. You are not to blame if you express your emotions and are met with criticism. You are not to blame if you try to make yourself understood and are met with indifference or if you follow your own truth and face backlash. You have the right to share your feelings, to be understood, and to follow your own path. Deep inside, you long to release all guilt and blame, allowing life to flow freely through you. You can live without these burdens. Your life truly begins now, as guilt and blame leave you, making way for crystalline clarity.

EXERCISE:
Place your hands on your jaw, letting it hang loose, with your mouth slightly open. Close your eyes. Then, plant a seed of intention within yourself, promising to let go of the guilt for being a person with needs and feelings. Release your jaw, rest your hands on your heart, and say to yourself: “I allow all guilt and blame to flow out of me, and I now face life with confidence.”

## The Veil

The most important person in your healing journey is you. However, this card reveals a tendency to focus on others as potential threats or obstacles in your life. While it’s true that people may have treated you poorly in the past, holding onto fear and mistrust only signals to others that you can still be treated badly. This is something you can change today. Right here and now, set aside your entire past, even if just for a moment. Focus solely on yourself and recognize that you are the creator of your own life. The seed of creation lies within you, and you hold the power to shape your future. Through your intentions and thoughts, you generate the vibrations that manifest your life experiences, events, and relationships. The best intentions come from your authentic self, so choose to dwell within the self to achieve the best results.

How do you dwell within the self? The first step is choosing not to resist the present moment. Accept whatever happens and embrace things as they are. The self is what remains when all analysis, judgment, and masks are stripped away.

Your past won’t stay in the drawer forever. You will need to address unresolved issues and accept everything that’s been suppressed within you, but not as a lens through which you view the world. Instead, face suppressed emotions and memories with acceptance and a sense of release. As you start living this way, the veil of fear and mistrust will gradually dissolve. This is the direction you’re headed. In fact, the moment has already arrived. Can you feel it?

---

## Pain

This card gently reminds you that releasing the pain you're carrying requires several steps. Begin by allowing yourself to process this pain. Let yourself cry if you need to. Practice holding space for your negative emotions without getting caught up in the stories your mind creates. Emotional pain is often repressed energy that needs to be acknowledged - it’s like a voice that needs to be heard before it can fade away on its own. Try not to resist the pain or judge yourself for feeling it. If your body needs to twist, tremble, or move, allow it to do so. Meet your pain with curiosity and acceptance. Though it’s not easy, this card assures you that light and happiness await on the other side. Your perseverance will be rewarded. Emotional pain has the potential to transform into strength and insight in a truly magical way, so don’t be discouraged. You’re on a fertile path, and you’ve already begun the process of healing. Embrace yourself right now, rocking back and forth as you say: “I redeem and set myself free.”

EXERCISE:
When you feel pain tearing at you, play some music and let your body move freely. Try not to overthink it—just let go and follow your body’s spontaneous movements. You might lie down on the floor or move around in a larger space. Pay attention to what happens to the pain and emotions in your body, and accept everything as it is.

## Mirroring

This card encourages you to become aware of how mirroring influences your life. Observe the authority figures, environments, friends, acquaintances, and family members around you. How do they behave towards you? What role do you typically assume in a group? How are you treated by leaders, therapists, or other authority figures? Mirroring often reflects what you subconsciously expect from others. If you feel that you’re being treated poorly, it may stem from others reflecting your own low self-esteem or sense of inferiority, rather than from their bad intentions. Recognizing this can be a powerful wake-up call, helping you take steps to distance yourself from inaccurate and negative self-images. Becoming aware of mirroring can be an invaluable tool for personal growth.

Embrace curiosity and gratitude for the way life reveals these insights to you. Start to realize that you are an amazing person with inherent value, deserving of good things. Imagine how your life can transform with this understanding.

EXERCISE:
Close your eyes and imagine the following: You are standing in the middle of a large group of people, and they are all facing you, smiling and clapping. You nod in acknowledgment, and your eyes shine brightly as you look at them. You breathe deeply and naturally, feeling the deserved praise for being your true self. Everyone likes you. You are a part of everyone, and they are a part of you.

## Healthy Network

Take great care in cultivating your social network, ensuring that the people in your life support your healing and the emergence of a genuine, valuable, and self-sustaining self. This is especially important if you have played the role of the scapegoat. Pay close attention to how you feel in the presence of others. Be curious and discern who supports you and who drains your energy. Don’t be afraid to distance yourself, either partially or completely, from certain individuals for a while. When you are in a vulnerable phase of healing, it’s crucial to surround yourself with healthy environments that nurture and uplift you. You need relationships built on respect, dignity, and caring communication.

EXERCISE:
Write a letter to those who have used you as a scapegoat in the past or are doing so now. Express how you feel and what the experience has been like for you. Clearly state that you will no longer take on this role, and that they must now take responsibility for their own emotional issues and everything else that belongs to them. Conclude by thanking them for the insights you’ve gained from your experiences as a scapegoat. Acknowledge that there is a deeper meaning to everything and that you accept life as it has been.

You may choose to burn these letters afterward, as the act of writing them—even if not shared—can work within you and may help heal the relationship over time. Good luck!

## Forgiveness

A person who lives fully and authentically from a transparent core often doesn’t need to concern themselves with forgiveness — love and acceptance flow through them naturally and unconditionally. Drawing this card may suggest that you’ve reached a higher level of spiritual awareness and already feel the power of forgiveness within you. Alternatively, it could indicate that you still need to forgive. Reflect on which applies to you. Do you feel a sense of ownership over your own story? Are you in touch with what has happened to you, and do you have natural access to your emotions? If you answered no, you might be carrying grief and feeding yourself with negative thoughts and self-sabotage. You could be angry at yourself for making choices that have deepened your pain or for avoiding the choices you truly needed. Now is the time to forgive yourself. You did your best. You couldn’t have done it differently, so release yourself and choose to be present in the here and now.

There is another aspect to this card. It cautions against rushing into forgiveness just to avoid setting boundaries with those who have hurt you. True forgiveness must come from your authentic self. If it doesn’t, you may be deceiving yourself in an effort to avoid discomfort and internal conflict. Embrace all the emotions that reside within you, and then forgive the people who caused the pain and taught you to suppress it. What awaits you on the other side of this journey is worth the effort!

## Thumbs Up

The world is full of people with stories similar to yours. Seek fellowship with some of them. Look to social media for posts that can give you the motivation you need. It is always good to see people share their experiences and inspire you to become braver and to make good choices. There are so many talented and mindful people who share their lives, and who may have created lovely meditations, meaningful words, and perhaps even support groups you can join.
Add this to your daily routine. Turn off your usual TV channels and search for new programs with meaning, or search out good books and audio clips that can give you the support you need. Avoid distracting yourself from this important process you are going through. Start diving into all this material, so you may feed your mind with understanding, nourishment, and healing. Now is your time. You will wake up to your true self, and access your power. Experiences that you deserve and can benefit from will come to you.
This is truly a time of joy, dear friend. You may not be aware of it now, but this new focus may change your life forever. Thumbs up for you!

## The Fog

Sometimes, circumstances can envelop you in a fog that clouds your thoughts and replaces clarity with anxiety and discomfort. It can be unsettling—how do you navigate and find the right path? Feeling clear, visible, and equal to others might seem like a challenge. It can be difficult to express your story, wishes, and needs with a clear voice. This card encourages you to trust in who you are; you’re about to shine through the fog! Soon, you will break through the uncertainty, and during this time, the old patterns that have shaped your reality will begin to fade. This period may feel uncomfortable because trusting in your authentic voice is new and unfamiliar to you. However, keep reminding yourself of where you’re headed. And where is that? You’re moving out of the fog and into the sunshine that is waiting for you with open arms!
               
               EXERCISE:
               Try a fun exercise that combines housekeeping with some inner cleansing. As you clean surfaces and windows, imagine yourself washing away all falsehoods and shadows. Notice how good it feels to see things with clarity. Through this simple action, you’re redirecting your energy and attention toward acceptance and inner focus, even during everyday chores. You’re becoming more aware of what you need and actively taking steps toward reclaiming yourself—becoming clear, visible, and transparent.

## Invalidation

This card suggests that you may harbor an inner sense of unworthiness, a self-judgment that can feel like a heavy, oppressive cloud, influencing the choices you make. This perception might lead you to approach others with skepticism and suspicion, causing you to judge them harshly and view new friendships, alliances, and groups with discouragement. You may even find yourself searching for evidence that you are being excluded or that no one wants to be around you. If this resonates with you, this card gently and lovingly encourages you to release these beliefs. They are simply not true. You belong! Your feelings belong, and they are normal. Everyone experiences emotions and, at times, an unstable and changing inner world that can lead to insecurity, fear, and skepticism. All feelings are allowed. If yours do not seem to fit the norm, this comes from pure misconception. It simply is not true.
               You must be willing to take a chance, to participate in groups, and not give up, even if you have negative thoughts or feel discomfort. Claim your space and move forward—embrace all your feelings and be who you are, fully. The Persian poet Rumi wrote, "The wound is the place where the light enters you." So, dare to own and reveal your wounds, and claim your space. This card assures you that you will be amazed at the relief and freedom that will follow.

## Endurance

Imagine a powerful tree with branches and shoots extending in every direction. This growth is made possible by a vast network of roots, which steadily supply nutrients over time. When a green leaf appears in the spring, it is the result of a long process of development and preparation that began in the autumn of the previous year. Similarly, for something to manifest in your life, it takes time. What you have today is the outcome of what came before. The investments you’ve made and the nourishment you’ve given yourself will soon materialize. Patience is essential. You must endure the time it takes for your good choices to bear fruit and manifest results.
               
               By choosing positivity and encouragement—and distancing yourself from misconceptions and negative attitudes—you allow a new flow of nutrients from your roots. This will foster a renewed sense of identity, making it easier to feel strong and self-reliant. However, be prepared for these results to take time. Let go of any expectation that they will appear immediately; instead, embrace the element of surprise. It is impossible for you to lose the life force within you or your unique essence. Know that these qualities are on their way to making your life reflect who you truly are. This process is inevitable. Trust in it.

## Welcome Home

My dear one, come in, sit down, and allow yourself to feel completely at home. This is your sanctuary—a safe space where you can rest and recharge. Everything here is crafted to your taste and desires. The air is nourishing and fresh, and the light flows through, pure and golden, allowing you to see things as they truly are. You can always trust in this clarity. Inside this home, only you choose the colors. Only you decide what stays or goes. Everything here belongs to you, existing solely to provide you with security, love, and support. This home will never leave you—just as the sky can never disappear. It is always here, warm and open, waiting for you.
               
               Dear friend, relax and find peace here. Let the loving energy embrace you, flow through you, purify you, and leave you with the deep contentment you deserve. Watch as your life brightens, guided by invisible hands that lead you over streams and through thorny paths. See good people coming into your life, smiling at you, admiring you. They notice all the treasures you hold and share, and you notice and celebrate theirs. Picture laughter, celebration, the natural holding of hands, and take immense joy in being together. This is your natural life, the one you were given at birth. You are in this life. Welcome home.

## The Guide

If you live with shame and feelings of inferiority, you may not have experienced life as the safe harbor it can be. Perhaps you've been enduring chronic anxiety, worry, and concern, with your everyday life revolving around managing these internal struggles.

This card serves as a reminder that inner contemplation awakens deeper senses and enhances your focus and clarity. This is incredibly valuable. The pain you carry can actually become the fuel for your journey toward truth, honesty, courage, and loyalty. Let your life be a beacon for others.

We are entering a new era, one that will require people who can recognize falsehoods and have the courage to call them out, living authentically. More people like you will emerge—those who grow stronger and more honest through their suffering. You could be a pioneer, a trailblazer lighting the way for others. Know that you possess the ability to help and guide others toward awakening and a deeper understanding of life. You are a valuable, irreplaceable resource to society.

EXERCISE:
Consider getting a piece of jewelry that symbolizes this important role you hold, and wear it with pride.

## Turning Point

This card is an exercise in writing – with the goal of reversing negative and unfortunate thinking in a specific area of your life. Consider whether you are holding on to a fear or worry in your body right now. Get a notepad and write down what the issues are and what your thoughts around them are. For example: “I feel that I am afraid of losing new and good things in my life. I am afraid to fight for what I want. I visualize myself as unsuccessful and anxious in situations where I have felt this way before, and I am worried that this will continue.”

Try your best not to analyze or reflect on the sentences you have written, but rather focus on the recovery and repair phase. Address each sentence by rewriting them. For example: “I trust that the new and good things in my life will stay with me. I feel safe knowing that I will receive what I want and need. I visualize myself mastering and succeeding in all the situations that are important to me. My life is good, and I am lucky and delighted to be able to participate in it.”

In doing this exercise, your energy undergoes a transformation, from heavy to light, from dark to bright. On the other hand, if you sense resistance, just wait a while until your body feels more receptive. This exercise will be very helpful to you in the long run. The words are just a pathway into your inner source, where good thoughts and self-love spring forth naturally and effortlessly. Be kind and patient with yourself. The goal of this is to create vibrations that arise from within you, and that the rhythm of your entire being attracts and manifests the life you wish for.

## Friendship

This card highlights the importance of good and loving relationships. You need good friends in your life. You are not standing on the outside, and you are not different from everybody else. You have the same value, and you are loved in the same way. Even if you sometimes may feel left out, you must take a chance to show love and interest. This is an investment in your own happiness and joyful moments. Choose to trust people. Choose to see the best in them. Expect others to like you and welcome you. All of this will send the negative clouds away, and allow the light inside you to reach out and touch others. You are your own unique soul!
Life is an arena and a journey where we all meet, share, and experience everything amazing that life entails. Make sure your journey is rich moving forward. It should be filled with honest encounters and good relationships, where you let no day pass without moments of dedicated love.

Tell yourself: “I will live with love, honesty, and trust. I will no longer punish myself by distrusting others, or by believing that life is worse for me or that I do not deserve good company. I deserve love. I love others and I love myself."

## World Map

This card reveals the map inside you that displays the societal and world perspectives that have formed throughout your life. A map like this is based on experiences, opinions, attitudes, ideas, and insights. You may have already colored the map and drawn different areas with a black pen. You may have outlined a path that shows where it is safe for you to walk, and another path assigned for certain times of the day. No matter what your map looks like, this card is asking you to review whether anything can be changed.

Over time, you may want to replace parts of this map so that you see everything with new eyes, open and curious. Perhaps a new relationship will form between you and your community, reflecting the real and good person you are. You belong, and you are good enough. Your perseverance—and the achievement of breaking free from what has held you back from being yourself—will also contribute to making you a good and caring citizen. One who understands. One who sees and accepts others.

EXERCISE:
You may want to create your own actual map. Add your thoughts and views on current topics and matters that are important to you. You can write what you think about absolutely anything. This is an exercise that provides validity and visibility to your voice and who you are. Do as much with it as you want and need.

## Tool Box

This card is a toolbox containing three essential tools, each in the form of a message:

Truth
Feelings
Trust
Choose the tool you need today. Picture a toolbox with three compartments: the left is green, the middle is red, and the right is blue. Which color draws you in? Read and apply the advice linked to your chosen color. Good luck!

Blue: Always tell the truth.
The source of truth lies within you, and when it flows from this source, you can feel it in your heart. There is no need for doubt. You know it is true, so let it be, and do not invent questions or plant any new seeds of doubt. Sometimes, the truth may conflict with your need for comfort and predictability, and you might trick yourself into ignoring it, hoping it will just go away. In those moments, remind yourself of the great value in telling the truth, and that what you feel in the moment is just part of a greater whole. Change occurs only through dealing with yourself honestly, so promise to always act on the truth. However, this does not mean that you should share everything you know with others. Refraining from speaking can be wise in many cases, and others do not always need to know what you know. But when circumstances demand an answer, and you are challenged to say something, speak the truth.

Red: Own your emotions.
If you carry shame that has been projected onto you, it still belongs to you. Someone may have shamed you to distract from their own feelings, but the shame you carry today is nonetheless yours. Emotions can only be integrated when you claim ownership of them. You can learn the "wrap yourself in light" method so that others can't project their feelings onto you. Wrap yourself in moving fields of light. If you start feeling anger creeping in, seemingly triggered by another person, let the light absorb it, but also take ownership of how that anger affects you. Remember that all emotions are energy that can be of use. You have the ability to change how you experience all feelings by not resisting them or overthinking them. Explore this! Next time, try sinking into your anger and feel the magic. What happens when you heat up water? It evaporates. In the same way, you are an alchemist, transforming the energy of emotions when you take ownership of them.

Green: Choose trust.
Our thoughts constantly feed us theories and opinions about how things are connected, and about what others may think and believe. Can I trust in life? Can I trust him or her? There isn’t just one answer to these questions, because so many considerations and infinite causal connections are involved. We cannot fully understand life because we are bound by our experiences and roles. This card reveals that the best starting point, however, is choosing trust. Choose to trust life and other people. Seek out the light in others and in everything that surrounds you. Rejoice in being able to choose trust. Remember that this trust should not stem from inferiority or from giving away your power, which is motivated by fear rather than trust. Instead, it should come from within you, from the self that has resources and power, and stands on your own two feet. This self in you cherishes life and other people. Be confident that this will provide the best results.

---

## Awake

One aspect of you is spiritually awake. This means you have a center of clarity within you. You can distance yourself from everyday drama and events—not in denial, but by truly and securely dwelling in your spiritual being. This provides great freedom because it allows you to sense without emotional attachments and pain. It’s as though you can soar above the earth and observe life from an eagle’s perspective. From this vantage point, you will feel instant gratitude for being part of, and participating in, the incredible journey that life is. It unfolds effortlessly on its own through every moment, and you can choose to witness it.

Know that all sorrow, anxiety, and loss disappear in this state of awareness. This can be difficult to understand, especially when the lower aspects of you may carry heavy feelings and thoughts that seem real enough in themselves. But this will not remain the truth forever. It is transient, like a cloud formation that dissolves in the sky. The reason suffering can last so long is often due to resistance to feeling and accepting what is, and to the storing and repeating of patterns, roles, and inner programs. Do not deny anything. Decide today. It's like throwing yourself into each moment and being able to say out loud: “I trust life to carry me. I choose to be aware."

---

## Spiritual Self

You sprang forth into this life from the seed of God. You are of spirit. But in this world, you are also of the earth, through your body and the role you play. There are many different parts of you that experience, sense, and process life. Your body and mind are connected to the laws of nature and to your primary needs: to feel safe, fed, protected, and happy. You deserve all of this. However, these needs may be threatened at different stages of life. Perhaps you have sought out your spiritual self for help and enlightenment. Maybe you have pursued spiritual footholds through groups or people that offer you helpful solutions. Sometimes, we can be tempted into spirituality as an extension of a heartfelt desire. We may even become teachers as soon as we learn something ourselves or after taking ownership of experiences we have along the way. In these moments, it is important to remind ourselves that all wishes fade away in the presence of the divine and that it is enough to simply exist. Life is transformed, and the external backdrop is broken through. You will experience freedom from any agenda and find yourself in continuous sharing because you are overflowing with truth.

The tasks and challenges of your earthly role cannot, however, vanish through your longing for your spiritual self. But through your human experience, you may meet and awaken your spiritual aspects by gradually learning your lessons and by relinquishing and surrendering your role. Giving up the mind’s power over your life means opening up to the spirit and to love.

Awakening to your spiritual self happens incrementally – drop by drop. Resist temptations and quick fixes, and allow your inner compass to guide you. Trust your intuition and inner knowledge, and trust yourself. Seek comfort in prayer and contemplation, and refrain from creating new stories – good or bad. Fellowship with others on the same journey as you is nourishing and good. Live in the now and accept emotions as they come. Everything is happening in the moment. Can you feel it? You may light a candle to celebrate your inner light.

PRAYER:
In the light of God, I am worthy, I am whole, I am free. Allow love, truth, and trust to shine through and fill my life – and everyone else’s lives – with spiritual light. Amen.

---

## Justice

This card reveals that justice will prevail in the end. The wrongs and losses you have witnessed must have affected your trust. Feelings of disappointment have been painful, and your inner endurance has been tested. You know you are on a path to somewhere, but you have not yet reached your destination. Examine the lion’s eyes. It knows it’s all worth it. Victory is in sight, and everything will work out for you.

True justice can seldom be measured or weighed, as there are so many unseen and unknown factors. We do not yet know all the answers in life or about the tremendous grace in action behind the scenes. Trust that life knows what is best for you and that you can rely on the guidance from your soft inner voice. Someone is watching over you. All is well.

EXERCISE:
Imagine yourself as a human scale. Each of your arms holds a bowl. Your fulfilled dreams and wishes fill the right bowl. The left bowl holds all your unfulfilled and unmet dreams and wishes. Now test how the scale tilts. If you were able to add your own amount of self-declared justice, what would the bowls look like? Think about what justice means to you. Then see if you are able to let go of the power of defining what justice looks like and choose to trust that it will eventually be fair.

# Deck: spiritualAwarenessCards

## Authentic Self

Since your life began, you have hosted a pure and potent awareness at the core of your being, manifested as feelings and impulses. But through experience and upbringing, you learned to identify with characteristics and constructed false selves and not actually your authentic self. So when you ask yourself who you are, you land in these insidious fields instead of the deep recognition of yourself. Now is the time to discover the powerful you. You will be delighted at how great it feels to return home.

---

## Awareness

The sea of awareness is enriched with sensations you thought impossible. The birth of higher consciousness happens to drop by drop, and a single drop has the power to enlighten you. Your awareness will gradually integrate and challenge how you are used to thinking and sensing. One day it will clear the fog covering the truth, and a new world will be revealed to you. New knowledge and understanding will emerge. You are reaching toward higher consciousness and wisdom. Reverence shines upon you.

---

## Blossoming

You must have done some good recently because this moment did not arrive easily. Now or in the near future, you will discover a treasure providing you with a great blessing. It may be in the form of a meeting or a gift you receive, or you will unveil a place within you that becomes the origin of transformation. This will delight you and inspire gratitude, but the one you should genuinely thank is yourself. You have secured this treasure as a part of your life. Be proud.

---

## Duality

Reality begins dissolving, and you start to understand things exist outside, above, and below what we call life. There exists an intelligence of creation and a witness, and you are born out of this and possess the same qualities inside of you. In duality, life is characterized by the illusions dominating, and we all forget that we have created the movie in which we live. Now is the time for you to take a step back, examine the polarities, and see them for what they are without being overwhelmed by them. Explore behind the scenes, and study the view from there.

---

## Spiderman

Everyone is at risk of exposure to their own or others’ darker sides. You could be a pawn in a game or have bad qualities and feelings projected upon you. This card does not mean that a bad thing will happen. It is intended to inform and asks you to be aware of what you allow from other people or yourself and whether you 'sell your soul' to avoid discomfort. Well, getting caught in the spider’s web is not comfortable, so be strong and retain your soul. You are worth it.

---

## Energy Thief

Pay attention to what goes on around you. Do you lose energy in conversations, meetings, and situations with people you thought you were close to? This card wants you to discover the truth about relationships that expose you to energy theft. Others may be “feeding on” your honesty and vulnerability, draining your energy. This card advises you to remain vulnerable and open but also focus on being centered and connected to your endless source of power. Your own thought patterns may also act as an energy thief. Be careful.

---

## The Angel

An angel is protecting you right now. Its wings envelop you, so let go of your struggles and allow yourself to be carried for a while. Let your tears flow freely and expose the sadness in your chest. The angel is here to comfort you and tell you those good things are coming, even though it might not feel like it right now. Follow your guidance and feel the power under the angel’s wings. This is your power. All will be well, and you can proceed with confidence.

---

## The Colour Tamer

In this card, feelings are colors, and you are the tamer of feelings. It requires immense internal honesty to juggle without deception or projections. This card confirms that you possess that honesty but are now being tested. Do you claim your emotions, even when you could transfer negative ones to others nearby? You will make an impression on people and even help them see the value of their feelings and pride in owning, containing, and healthily expressing them. Show your creative and generous nature.

---

## Celebration

The emotions flowing through you will grant you great satisfaction if you allow them. Happiness is a state of inner joy and harmony, which fills your being with confidence and removes unrest. Maybe you have been living with anxiety and felt that you are not living the life you desire. This card tells you that the era of joy is here. It's time to celebrate that happiness lives in you and does not rely on external circumstances. You have now reached a point where you can see the nature of truth. Be proud and love yourself.

---

## The Mountain

Climbing to the top of a mountain gives a great sense of achievement, particularly when the ascent is demanding. This card warns that hard work is ahead and that there will be many challenges down the road. You have already come a long way, and the goals are clear, but great effort is still required to submit that final peak. However, this card also explains that the light shines in the valley and that there are paths around the mountain that lead to roughly the same place. This is the time to reassess your goals and make a decision.

---

## Redemption

It's time to swim in the turquoise blue lagoon. Let go of struggle and flow with the water. This card predicts a profound redemption. This is the moment to accept life’s realities. You have done your best and there’s nothing more you can do now. Embrace this realization and let yourself be enveloped by the pulsating energies as they emerge from hiding. In a few days, you will achieve deep clarity due to this redemption. Be free.

---

## Fertility

Are you aware of your abilities? Your potential is infinite. This is a productive time to discover your creative powers and realize how easily you can manifest your wishes. Although it occurs automatically for many, creation is steadily given to us, and we continually create moments and experiences. You now have the opportunity for awareness and to discover the fascinating life that is taking shape moment by moment. Seize it!

---

## The Gift

You will receive a gift. It can be an item, an act, an opportunity, or a specific experience, and you will recognize it. This gift can bring significant changes. Receiving it without resistance is your current challenge. In the past, you have often felt the need to reciprocate gifts and to thank in excess when receiving something. Be grateful, but your primary task is embracing the blessing and opening yourself to new self-knowledge and maturity. Welcome this deserved reward!

---

## Breakthrough

Congratulations! You are on the path to seeing yourself in a new light or have already reached it. Sometimes renewal comes to us as a ripple effect from good choices made over time. Still, now you have come upon an excellent opportunity to break out of your pattern. This is a new source of inspiration, and you will be delighted. A breakthrough like this means that you are gaining strength in an area where you used to feel weak and insecure, and now you bravely dare to take the space you deserve. Enjoy it.

---

## The Cheapskate

Sometimes we misunderstand and think we must hold on tightly to our love, gifts, and money. We fear sharing and losing and do not wish to be visible or vulnerable. The cheapskate has a bad reputation but is actually just afraid. They develop from a place of scarcity, not expecting gifts from above, and therefore fortify and guard their treasures. But as soon as they give of themselves and let love in, the heavens will open, and gifts will pour down on them. It's time to break a pattern.

---

## The Cave

Have you been neglecting rest? It’s time for seclusion and contemplation. This is your opportunity to recover power and energy and unite these forces within you. Meditate every day. Get comfortable with the silence within and enrich yourself with the answers that emerge. The silence surrounding you will open doors to a new level of consciousness. You have been waiting for this.

---

## Goddess

Your spiritual self, your pure consciousness, emerges more clearly than ever. This could have frightened you at some point and overwhelmed your nerves and emotions, which won't happen now. Your flexibility and purification have prepared you to bathe in spiritual light, and you will be profoundly enchanted. Life appears in its purest form and takes your perceptions to heights unknown. Watching a bird in a tree will bring you immense satisfaction.

---

## Action

The wheel of life needs your hand to continue turning and to lead you to your desired destination. This is the time for action, don’t be fooled into sitting still. Be brave and make choices. Do not hold back now! The wheel’s central light reassures you in going that extra mile to reach the finishing line. Keep at it!

---

## Harmony

Bright days are ahead. Joy rises from within you, and you will enjoy great fulfillment. Moreover, deserved praise will come from near and far. You are in balance, and life rewards you with a sense of victory. Let your creativity bloom: Start painting, create something using your hands, play with words, or cook something delicious. Suddenly, you’ll have discovered the recipe of the year! When in balance, we invite adventure into our lives and allow ourselves to feel the essence of harmony. Let it last!

Romance is in the air. This could be seeing a current partner in a new light or a new person entering your life.

## The Observer

If you’re currently under a lot of stress, take comfort in knowing that you will find great help by retiring and analyzing. It can be challenging to take a step back when you crave a solution and feel overwhelmed by the circumstances of life. Still, trust that this is what is best for you. In the beginning, your feelings will be all over the place, but take your time, and you will discover a shift in your inner being. Suddenly, this will be a minor mark on the map of your life. All is well. You can feel safe taking that next step.

---

## Illusions

Have you been choosing the easy way out recently? This card reveals that you do not make the best choices for yourself. A cloud of self-deception and illusory desires dominates. It's easy to ignore the inner voice that wishes to awaken you. Remember that illusions are not real and that anything you achieve through them will run like sand through your fingers. Try locating your core and clearing your vision. It's time to see reality as it is. Only then will you be able to access the power within. Be honest with yourself.

---

## Inner Critic

The critical voice within is often an extension of the negative sides of our upbringing. It makes us repeat our mistakes and monitors the map of our inner world, showing us where it's safe to go to avoid making mistakes, and where all the dangers lie. However, the map does not display your abilities, potential, strength, courage, and all the areas of growth where you can live and flourish. It only functions to avoid failure. But life is an adventure, and you're here to discover it yourself, so expel this critic from your life!

---

## Empress

Your growing identity is not the result of meticulous programming. Instead, this emerging figure is brand new and one that knows its value. It is warm, loving, and powerful.

The Empress symbolizes abundance, and her fruits are rich and succulent. She invites others to step forward and embraces everyone. What growth you've achieved!

---

## The Source

You might find yourself in a situation where you feel confused and are looking for answers.

This card advises you to seek the source within from where all manifestations and desires spring. It is the origin of life, and you can find strength and rest here. The source holds limitless potential, as do your creative abilities. Sink in and allow yourself to be filled with it.

---

## Love

You deserve love. Profound love is coming your way. It may arrive as a new partner or friend or be an inner experience. Be aware that this love truly originates in you. It has always been there, and your awareness is now awakening to see it. The universe wants you to swim in a rich, comfortable, and enclosed lagoon that fills every cell of your body with light. This gift has been given to you. Now your surroundings will confirm this as the truth. You are loved.

---

## The Tree of Life

The tree of life absorbs nourishment from the earth and distributes it to all its branches. It trusts that its fruits are good and radiates calmness and stability. These characteristics will be essential for you now. Good news awaits you. Perhaps an answer you have been waiting for will be revealed, or a new and pleasant surprise will materialize. Stay collected and believe in yourself. Remain calm. Enjoy the fruits of your labour with dignity and inner peace.

---

## Web of Life

If your life was a piece of woven cloth, what would it look like? Would the patterns of your life be synchronous and beautiful, or would the fabric be full of gaps, protrusions, and mistakes? Most people want a little bit of everything. This card reveals a guiding hand within the web of life that will make your life much more harmonious.

When you get used to looking at life this way, it will be easy to follow your light.

---

## Magic

These are exciting times. Magic can be confused with trickery, but be sure that the forces surrounding you intend to help you. Expect the unexpected, and know that clues will not always be clear. They may arrive as divine intervention or through small elves pulling strings. Either way, join the magical dance, and you can end up with a different but better starting point. Allow yourself to be surprised.

---

## The Mask

You now have the opportunity to remove your mask and show your true face. This act may feel uncomfortable because the steps you take release you, but know that this release is entirely yours and deserves the right to life. Removing the mask is a primary act of self-love and self-respect. You are good enough! You can show your true feelings and what you are made of without filtering. Honesty is rewarded with inner peace, security, and a basic sense of being loved. Show who you are!

---

## Miracle

This is your victory, and you deserve it more than anyone else at this moment. Use this experience to rise into renewed confidence and hope for the greatest miracle of all: Life unfolding every moment. Congratulations.

---

## Brave

The color orange radiates courage. The animals in the picture risk everything for this daring venture. This card reminds you that you have the same capabilities and need to let them surface. Life will not improve unless you act with strength and integrity and show bravery. This card may also confirm that you have been brave for a while and are equipped to face future challenges confidently. Things will work out in your favor.

---

## Adversity

You are going through a time of trials. However, remember that friction and pressure are the major factors in the creation of diamonds and that in times of difficulties, it’s precisely hardships that spark transformation. Your inner turmoil comes from the energy you carry inside, which turns into anxiety when it can no longer be contained. To best free yourself from the unfortunate, life-impairing, and sabotaging patterns, the past should be remembered and shared. Still, the burden itself is something you now can stop hiding and carrying.

---

## Moonlight

Moonlight represents both love and the illusion of love. In this card, the moon represents the subconscious and unresolved; what we do not relate to as true. Perhaps you wish things were different from what reality shows you, and you’re clinging on to this hope. Avoiding the truth will make your life tainted by illusion, leading to false emotions. Others may perceive this and stay clear of you. Your advice is to seek inwards and embrace what is true. Grieve the loss of your illusions, and discover that you are much better off than you thought.

---

## The Joker

Life has a way of mocking us when we least expect it. However, it tends to occur when our will doesn't harmonize with what's best for us. Most people desire pleasure and comfort; therefore, we often resort to methods where we fool ourselves and perhaps others. This card states that you should not act from intellect but instead take an honest look inward. Take time to enlighten yourself to become aware of how you avoid the truth. You do not need trickery to get what you want. Life is fuller than you think.

---

## New Home

Changes are coming. This could be in the form of a new home, a new job, or perhaps you’ll get a long-awaited retreat in nature. It can also be about an inner homecoming. Be sure that this signifies life improving for the better. Security, comfort, and inner growth will be the benefits of these changes. Take a deep breath and be grateful for your life right now. You are lucky and profoundly blessed.

---

## Attention

Your essence longs to be one with being, to rest in itself. What is holding you back? Your attention is not in being, but in thoughts and issues, in the past or in the future. Now is the time to merge with the present and refocus on the inner knowledge that springs from spiritual attention. It is dormant but attentive, clairvoyant, and vibrating with life itself. It is time for spiritual growth and new clarity.

---

## Awakening

You are approaching a period of wonder. Waking to the true nature of life feels lighter than the sun and fresher than the breeze above a field of flowers. Your senses will open up and invite grateful and fascinating observations. You will break from old restricting notions and discover what is hidden behind the scenes of life. Is it this beautiful? Could it be true? Embrace this awakening that comes to you. It is an internal spring that is here to stay.

---

## Abundance

This card foretells financial gain in the form of an inheritance, winnings, unexpected gifts, or quick success increasing your income. The golden floodgates of the sky will open and shower you with coins in a celebration of prosperity and delight. Do not ask how you can be so fortunate; it is not about luck. Rather, these are the fruits of your past positive investments, and now is the time for harvest. You know wealth tastes best when shared, so invite others to join in the celebration!

---

## The Journey

Everyone is on a journey through life, but there is also a parallel journey in consciousness. Initially, this other journey is solitary, but this card reveals a sharing of experience and growth with others. Other people will now be more important to you. Choose your environment and people carefully. Find those who seek the light within themselves and others and want fellowship. Find those who want to meet you on this abundant journey and who are true to themselves.

---

## The Truth

Every once in a while, a crystal clear truth emerges to show you how things actually work. This is such a moment. The thoughts coming to you now reveal the truth about a situation. You have the power to distinguish between what is real and what is fantasy or fear by sensing your heart’s reaction to the thoughts. Truth can bring pain, but it is heartfelt and profoundly redeeming. That is something you will never find through fear or fantasy.

---

## Anger

Do you have a lot of suppressed emotions tearing at your insides? Or perhaps you feel that you’ve had enough. Anger often hides grief or deep pain. Do not battle your feelings; instead, recognize your rage. Embrace it as if you are falling deep down into a well. Tears might come. Perhaps you will feel a sense of relief. Acceptance and self-knowledge can free the energy of anger. Explore and be amazed.

---

## Soul Whisperer

Life's challenges can be deeply painful. Wounds may be endlessly reopened, or needs and wishes stay unfulfilled. When the soul whisperer comes to you, it is with the message of a higher purpose behind your difficulties. You can rest assured that everything is well. Time will show you why things currently are as they are. Trust the inner guidance you are now receiving because it is crystal clear.

---

## Soul Agriculture

This card advises you to nurture your spiritual side, just like a farmer looks after the soil, to get good crops. You are encouraged to spend time meditating and focusing on inner silence and to embrace impressions with love. Your whole being needs care, and healing steps must be taken. By doing this, you will gain more kindness and fortunate situations than you have now. Your spiritual crop is already rich and healthy; it only needs continued watering and loving care. Be good to yourself.

---

## Wheel of Destiny

We usually make choices that benefit us, but they can sometimes collide with each other and leave us bogged down. This is when destiny will intervene with assurances and a little assistance. Life cares about you, and you will soon notice its involvement. It could come in the form of enlightenment on a specific topic or the solving of problematic external issues. The help may also arrive in the condition of human support and financial aid.

---

## The Jewelstones

Sometimes help arrives from totally unexpected places; at other times, you can be astonished by others’ generosity. You will receive support soon; be thankful and embrace it. You deserve this gift. You are beautiful, and your inner light needs to become visible to others. For some time, moving forward, you will significantly benefit from the symbolic jewels you are wearing. Prepare yourself for a new acknowledgment that will bring you immense joy.

---

## The Sun

As the sun shines, smiles appear, but the sunlight also reveals things we do not always want others to see. This card manifest itself when identity, inner security, and visibility are questioned. You are invited to dance when you let your light shine and feel grateful for your role on earth and all aspects of your being. The women pictured truly like themselves, and they are celebrating the experience that is life. The sun shines both from them as well as upon them. Here is your invitation to join!

---

## Silence

We are used to reaching for books, other people, or the internet to find answers. But this card speaks of the answers found in silence. There is a well of valuable information hidden in silence, which you can access once you remove yourself from external stimuli. You might have to battle boredom or unrest at first but stay committed. This is the right time to break the sound barrier and discover a new, dazzling world of wisdom.

---

## Strength

This card reveals the incredible strength you have gained through your courage and endurance. The building blocks for manifesting your chosen life are ready. All possibilities are open. What do you want to create? You have the power and strength to overcome most obstacles and are highly likely to manage them efficiently. This is a card of victory for work accomplished. Give yourself a pat on the back before you start making your dreams come through.

---

## Support

You need good friends in your life. Friends that make you feel good and strong, especially around other people. Loyalty and closeness are essential right now. Know that you deserve supportive friends that keep the space open and bright when needed. Friends who lift you and protect you in challenging situations. You are a giving person, but remember to receive as well. Rest and lower your guard, and feel that loyalties towards you are genuine.

---

## Success

Things are going your way, and you will soon enjoy an even more significant victory in your efforts and hard work. This success has been long-awaited and is just as much about realizing a vision as it can involve rewards in terms of reputation or increased wealth. It feels good to enjoy it at the top of the podium; others admire your achievements and are happy about your success.

---

## The Scapegoat

Do you feel like others tend to dump things on you? Are you used to being blamed or made accountable for other people’s feelings? The scapegoat indicates that you are carrying burdens that are not yours and allowing this form of abuse. Be crystal clear on boundaries, and break contact with those who exploit your vulnerabilities. When you stop being a scapegoat, you will experience energy you have never felt before. This is the time for self-care and growth.

---

## Transformation

The flower in the illustration is about to break through from the seal of its bud. Suddenly the grip loosens, and the petals are free to unfold, find their place and become a beautiful rose. This immense change happens in less than a minute. That is the effect this transformation card now has on your life. New beginnings appear out of the blue as an immediate result of your transformation. The energy released this way can do wonders. It does not require any diligence or planning; these could act more as a hindrance. This change is destined by fate.

---

## Faith

This card encourages you to examine your beliefs. Familiarise yourself with the intentions behind your choices and thoughts. Are you sure your beliefs leave room to fulfill your potential? Practice how it feels when faith is put aside, and you stand face to face with experiences. Feel more than you think. The senses are the path to enjoying life and feeling healthy, vibrant, free, and happy. You will discover a new world when you allow yourself to live in a broader existence that does not limit beliefs or thoughts.

---

## Innocence

You will experience that the innocence you had as a child can be your greatest strength. Embrace your childlike feelings of trust for the situation you are currently in. It is safe to open up your heart. The innocence coursing through you does not originate in naivety or irresponsibility. Instead, it signifies that your soul’s light shines and fills you with gratitude. Do not fight this moment. Feel safe in your strength and that your innocence protects you and carries you towards experiences you never thought possible.

---

## Water Flower

The flower needs water to thrive. Similarly, you must allow tears to flow so you can digest, process, and feel well. You are not always able to cry and many times your tears annoy you. This card shows you that the tears are filled with colors and life, and that the reward for allowing yourself to let go is immense. Keep a flower in a vase at home, and imagine that the water flower reminds you that tears must be released to fill the vase and let the flower (you) shine.

---

## Wild at Heart

Have you looked in the mirror lately? You have a glow that arises from profound independence. This has not come easy, but it is the result of breaking away and being able to endure life's many trials. You have a wild heart. Your life reflects the beauty within you and is filled with fun and creative ideas that you generously share with those around you. Be proud. Show off your wild heart and inspire others to independence and freedom.

---

## Whirlwind

This card predicts a sudden wind that will blow away things you are used to having. At first, this will feel like a burden because it forces you to think differently and keep moving forward. After a while, the whirlwind will reveal itself as a catalyst for an exciting journey that will never end. You will be delighted by all the new discoveries and experiences and never want to return to how things were. You feel aligned with your life mission and will go on many wonderful internal and external journeys.

---

## Spirit

A master has reunited with his spiritual self, and awakened the divine into the human. In this process, an awareness takes place that opens up to see all of life's layers of illusions, and in addition to see what is real. The master bathes in light and enjoys the qualities of the light which are exuberant joy and gratitude, deep fascination and an intense love and freedom. The Master lives in you, and you are experiencing a great revival now. Indulge yourself.

# Deck: SENSITIVE SOUL

## Radiant Light
This card represents gifts and recognition.It speaks of a person who has done
immense inner work and has tapped into the sacred radiant light.
This light is the energy and vibration of happiness—
not superficial,
not material.
It is a happiness that comes from being awake in life,
in tune with your abilities and innate talents,
and able to express them without hindrance, shame, fear, or distortion.
Through this, the person brings forth creative work that vibrates with sacred energy,
allowing others to feel it,
receive nourishment, healing, inspiration, and relief.
This creative expression can take many forms:
Artwork, paintings, images, books, writing
Music
Therapeutic modalities the person works with
Or simply the person themselves—
someone who has become a golden being,
a person with sparkling eyes who has a healing effect on others.
It can also signify someone who can enter and transform difficult environments—
conflicts,
dysfunctional relationships,
spaces with locked or isolated energy.
They can often be amazing therapists or healers,working with people trapped in
heavy, stagnant situations.
Overall, this is a joyful card of:
Success,
Fulfillment,
Completeness,
Having conquered one’s inner karmic skeletons,
And discovered true, lasting value.

---

## Toxic Energy
This is the direct opposite of Radiant Light.
It represents:
Low-frequency energy,
Bad intentions,
Dark emotions—
envy,
blame,
scheming,
manipulation.
It can also point to narcissistic energy:
People who lie to save face,
Who care nothing for truth,
Focused only on control, power, and self-interest,
Absent of empathy, clarity, and sacred light.

---

## Roots
This card carries multiple meanings, and its interpretation depends on the person
asking the question and the energy they bring.
Are they seeking help and guidance?
Or are they simply looking for a boost or confirmation?
Positive meaning
The card can indicate that:
Old roots have been cut away,
A much better life situation is on its way,
New crops will grow because new seeds have been sown,
The old phase is over, completely ended at the root.
This is a strong and positive message, signifying that:
A cycle has ended,
A karmic circle has been completed,
And a long-standing problem is finally over.
You will no longer receive the old patterns, because the roots have been cut.If
anything from the past shows up, it is only residue—no new growth will come from
the old because the root is gone.
This is a powerful card of new beginnings, signaling:
Completely new results
A completely different life
When the old is not yet cut away
If the person cannot cut away the old, they may feel:
Continuous disappointments,
That the past keeps repeating itself.
In that case, the card means:
You haven’t fully cut the root yet.
You need to become very conscious about how you use your tools:
Your thinking,
What you validate,
How you use and manage your daily time,
And how responsible you are for your own energy and choices.
If you are still:
Projecting onto others,
Avoiding truly feeling what your own body and emotions are telling you,
Clinging to others,
Being difficult to deal with,
And not learning from the past,
…then the card warns:
You will recreate the old again.
The cycles will repeat,
And the karmic lessons will come around again until you finally understand,
learn, and commit to daily inner work

---

## Blister
This card directly represents repeating the mistakes of the past.
It is:
Wearing the same old shoes,
Even though you know they hurt,
They give you blisters,
But you keep walking in them anyway.
It is continuing to:
Seek love where it doesn’t exist,
Put yourself in situations where you suffer,
Project your unresolved feelings onto others,…even though you know better.
Blister urges:
Throw away the old shoes.
Learn from life’s lessons.

---

## Home Environment
This card represents what you grew up with.
It can reflect how things are at home now: your family situation, partner, and
children.
It can also point to your closest network, the relationships and constellations you
are part of.
The card indicates that our home environments often mirror the ones we grew up in.
When you grow up playing a certain role, you tend to continue playing that role. As
an adult, you often attract people who resemble the family members you had before.
This shows that there are deep, fundamental patterns in society and within the
psyche that are completely invisible, yet they work so deeply that they influence the
way people think and behave.
When you have a specific role and step out into the world—
into a completely new arena like work, a school, a new class,
into an environment where everything is seemingly new—
…at first, you may be perceived differently.
But over time, this invisible pattern begins to activate.
The subconscious mind starts to take over,
And the initial first-impression snapshots fade.
Gradually, through shared experiences, people begin to see you in the role you
have always carried.
It takes a lot to truly be seen in a new way—unless you yourself have fully broken out
of that role.
This is why people are often treated similarly wherever they go, once time passes and
interactions deepen.
The card reminds you that:
The way things are at home, you carry with you into all other relationships.
Having harmony and well-being at home is essential, because it affects how you
experience relationships outside the home.

---

## Vitamin
This is a positive and uplifting card that represents all that strengthens and nourishes
you.
It’s not just about:
food,
healthy routines,
diet and exercise,
or positive thinking.
It’s about everything that dissolves the lies about who you are—everything that
allows you to fully relax and feel aligned with your authentic self.
The body becomes able to rebalance itself for a calmer nervous system.The breath
can move deeper into the body.
This can involve:
Mantras, sound, vibrations,
The right people,
And perhaps soul connections that arrive as a kind of free assistance.
When you come together with these people, miracles seem to happen, because:
You share a long history on a soul level,
You bring out the best in each other,
There is no competition,
And your connection is nonkarmic.
These are people who do not enter your life to deliver karmic lessons.Instead, they
bring grace and support, only positive energy.
Encountering such people is a powerful indication that you are in the presence of the
right person—they are like bursting, radiant vitamins.

---

## The Thermometer
This card measures feelings, situations, environments, and relationships, and it is in
search of the inner vibe, the vibration, that “gut feeling,” that sensory impression you
get when you tune into something and it gives you information about whether it is
good for you or not.
This card indicates that it may be important to develop an inner thermometer—a
sense that can tune into people, relationships, work, choices you need to make, and
other life situations to get that immediate yes or no feeling.
Usually, when this card appears, it suggests that you need this ability because you
might be making choices that don’t align with your body’s signals. Ignoring the
body’s signals and the way it communicates can lead to many negative
consequences.
It can grow into larger problems that must be dealt with later. You might also enter
difficult relationships that are hard to break free from—or at the very least, you might
pay a high price to free yourself from dysfunctional connections and people.
The thermometer is therefore a golden tool, one that the person should develop and
learn to understand deeply.
However, there is also a caution:
Do not misread the thermometer.
Avoid becoming overly eager, reading energies in others that are not actually
there.
Because this card is ultimately about your own signals.
It is important to distinguish between:
1. A true energetic reading of a situation, person, or relationship, and
2. Your own internal fear, paranoia, or projections.

---

## Ananda
This card represents the spiritual home—a sacred state of liberation and elevation, of
being in union with all life.
Ananda is a celebration of:
our spiritual origin,
the beautiful vibration that we all are,
the core essence of life itself.
It is also connected to the Higher Self. This card speaks of being attuned to your
Higher Self, making conscious choices, and breaking free from old programming and
repetitive patterns.
It is about recognizing and surrendering to the vibration and essence that is truly you
—the authentic and eternal part of you.

---

## The Short Journey
This card is about life’s journey. But it is a journey of consciousness—a symbolic
journey rather than a literal one. It’s not about traveling across Asia right now, but
about the inner, symbolic path we walk.
On this journey, you might climb mountains, or fly in a plane that bypasses the
hardships and makes the journey easier. Sometimes you may swim in the ocean,
struggling with all the strength you have, and other times you might ride a scooter
straight ahead with no effort or cost.
This represents our journey of awareness. Sometimes we receive help; sometimes
grace strikes. We get the wind at our back, helping us out of difficult situations. Life
may place the right people in our path at the right time, offering gifts, solving
challenges, and opening doors for us.
But this journey can also bring challenging people at the perfect time—because there
are thresholds we must overcome and painful feelings we must face. Often it is other
people who trigger these feelings, or rejections, dismissals, and situations that
awaken wounds, shame, defeat, or fear.
The journey is ultimately about moving out of illusions and pain, because the higher
purpose is the soul’s path. We are spiritual beings having experiences here, but we
are never bound by those experiences. They can never define who we truly are.
When we start to live from this understanding, we break the link to the sources of
suffering—loss, rumination, negative self-images. We gain new eyes on the path of
life and begin to perceive what is truly real. We become capable of experiencing
nature, other people, moments, and the elements in a wondrous way, unfiltered by
the mind and its definitions.
This card reflects that path and is deeply encouraging, asking the person to keep
moving forward, to remain courageous and brave, to trust in life’s forces and the
journey itself.

---

## The Circle
This card represents the inner, private life—the world that lives within each of us. It is
as if each of us is a small island, and everything happening on that island is our inner
world.
This card speaks to:
The environment and climate on that island.
The boundaries around it.
Our responsibility for what grows there.
We are the ones who must cultivate the land, plow the fields, clear and nurture our
space, and maintain clean and healthy air around us. We not only hold this
responsibility, but we also have full authority over what grows on our inner island
and how we keep it clear.
No one else has the right to decide anything about that island or its inner climate.
Yet, often other people may have a grip on someone’s inner life if they are used to
controlling or dominating that person.
If a person does not take command of their life—does not claim their power—then
the “island” is left open, its windows unguarded, and it is easy for others to enter and
do as they please.
This card encourages setting boundaries and protecting the inner life. Just as the skin
protects the inner organs, we must also protect our aura—created through our
thoughts and self-validation. A strong and radiant aura keeps negative intentions and
toxic energies away.

---

## The Mask
This card is about how people wear masks. It can signify dishonesty and the act of
playing a game. It suggests that someone may not be honest with their intentions,
that they are trying to control outcomes by playing that game to achieve personal
gain.
This card can also represent the roles that all humans take on while on Earth. All the
masks of the human experience—our human identity—is full of roles and things we
identify with, which together form a “mask.”
If, for example, you grew up as the black sheep, a kind of scapegoat, then you have
identified with having flaws, with not belonging, with not being in the spotlight or
achieving success. It can then be difficult to truly feel good about yourself because
you are acting out a role of smallness and woundedness.
This card can therefore be interpreted in different ways.

---

## The Abuser
This is a very uncomfortable energy, representing people who overstep, break
boundaries—other people’s boundaries—and exploit or misuse others in various
ways.
This card can manifest in many degrees:
It can point to very serious situations.
Or it can refer to less severe patterns.
The text on this card is usually long and gives a thorough introduction to the
characteristics of the abuser. It also explains what makes a person attract such
people, and how the victim’s energy leaks, drawing them into relationships with this
type of person.

## Honey Tears
The first card, Honey Tears, speaks of the releasing tears. These are not the tears you
cry from suffering or despair, but tears that come when you surrender to release —
the power of transformation — when you finally let go of the pain and the story that
has carried the pain. All the old things you still hold onto.
This is a very good energy because it leads to rejuvenation, renewal, and a blissful,
ecstatic joy that can wash through the body in the time ahead. It’s not something you
can plan for or force; it comes through grace. It’s as if you have made good choices,
and in the right moment, you choose to surrender. Then, the releasing tears may
suddenly come, truly freeing you from pain, suffering, and anxiety.

## The Flame
Represents the healing and purifying energy that exists in many forms. You can call
upon it through specific figures, such as archangels, Jesus, spiritual light beings, and
angels. But you can also call upon it in the form of your Higher Self and your soul,
and of course, the universal light and the absolute, all-encompassing vibration.
The Flame is extremely healing. This card also invites you to remember that there
may be other people who share the same vibe, the same flame, the same energy and
frequency as you. Finding your authentic tone and daring to express it fully can
attract others who recognize it. This is not about what you think or about being
judged; it’s simply that they will feel the similarity in vibration. This can bring you
together with the right people, the right groups — those that bring real growth,
success, and progress — and what truly matters for your development.
When these two cards come together, they form a powerful energy station. They
speak of great potential for change, great potential for healing and improvement,
and the possibility of finally completing a situation that has been wearing you down,
so that you feel upgraded. The way there is to be truly honest, authentic in your
expression, and true to what you know is right and true. Let go of the stories, allow
yourself to be touched by these energies, and trust. Let go of controlling the process
yourself.

## Childhood
This card represents childhood and the work of healing oneself by working with the
inner child — and sometimes with other children — to release old sorrow and
transform what has happened. It is about recognizing that you carry the little child
within you, and that you can go and meet that child to make things better.
It’s as if that child is still there in your old childhood home, and you can change the
space — making it safe, bright, and good — so that the child feels secure,
comfortable, and able to move on from the memories or difficulties it has held.

## Freedom to Be Yourself
This card stands for having the space to move freely, to express yourself openly, to
breathe deeply when you speak with people — breathing deep into your belly, feeling
safe and open in your chest to express your needs, to say “no” when you mean it and
“yes” when you want to, and to dance or move without shame or restrictions.

## Grow Inward
This card speaks of gaining clarity when you turn your focus inward. Stop focusing on
others — the solution is to focus within. If you do the inner work, it will be reflected
outward, making you stronger and more grounded. You will feel better, create more,
and reap greater rewards, even if, on the outside, it may not look that way.
The inner work doesn’t always show itself immediately — just like in the image,
something grows and sprouts without being visibly apparent from the outside. Then
suddenly it appears, and it comes through entirely — radiating through the aura,
shining through the eyes, resonating in the voice, in the tone and pitch of the voice,
and in your actions without you even thinking about it.
It reflects where you are within yourself — whether you are sitting in the center of
yourself or out at the periphery, distracted, stressed, disconnected. This card points
to the path back to your own center.

## The Window
This card stands for different perceptions — that people see things differently
because they have different viewpoints. Looking from the inside out and from the
outside in offers different perspectives. It is important to understand that people
come from different places, and you cannot assume they will see or think the same
as you.
The card also advises, regarding yourself, not to be fixed in your own ideas of who
you are or how you appear. Be generous, spacious, and almost neutral toward
yourself so that things can move freely, and your true beauty can shine through
without interruption or interference.
