## Radiant Light and Toxic Energy
Their meaning depends on the question and the person’s context.
1. If the person is seeking healing:
It is clear that there is potential for deep healing from difficult energies.
Toxic energy often represents other people—or sometimes one’s own very
negative thought patterns, such as being overly critical and focused on
others’ flaws.
In that case, the advice is to surrender everything to the divine and begin
walking the true spiritual path.
1. If Radiant Light appears first, it often signals:
The person themselves does not carry the toxicity.
The toxic energy comes from others, from the environment, society, or
envious people.
The guidance is to:
Protect and guard oneself,
Maintain high standards,
Refuse to be pulled down,
Avoid judging the toxic people.
Instead, hold them in light,send love, andwish them well.
1. Another interpretation:
If the person wants to grow and rise further, this combination may
encourage them to actively clear out toxic relationships and
environments.
It can be an invitation to take on such tasks, because this person may have
extraordinary healing abilities and can help bring light to distorted
situations.
The message is to not fear toxic energy,but to see it as light that has been
distorted,and to hold firmly to the true radiant light.
This allows:
Situations to heal,
Great improvements to occur,
And the person to fully embrace their role as a light-bringer.

## Roots and Blister
When Uprooted and Blister appear together, they clearly speak of:
Repetition of the past,
The need to understand the cycles,
Learning karmic lessons to break free.
If lessons are not learned, the same experiences will return.
It is no use complaining,
Because it is the result of your own choices—or lack of them.
The core message is:
See reality clearly,
Become a responsible and conscious human being,
You reap what you sow.
We are divine creators,
And life will always reflect what we plant.
Alternative scenario: a message of hope
If the person:
Seeks comfort or healing,
Has already made many hard choices,
Done a lot of inner work,
But still feels exposed to injustice or deprived of what they deserve,
…then these two cards can carry a very positive message:
You will receive what you deserve.
The old truly has been cut away.
New times are coming.
The curse is broken.
The old shoes are gone—you will never wear them again.
You have:
Learned your karmic lessons,
Grown spiritually,
Chosen much better for yourself.
The results of that inner work are on their way,
Even if it always takes time for the outer reality to catch up.
Now comes:
A new life,
Completely new experiences,
Results that do not hurt you,
And the old cycles are finally left behind forever.

## Home Environment and Vitamin
When we see the Vitamin card together with Home Environment, it reinforces the
message of:
How vital it is to feel well at home.
If you don’t feel good at home, then:
You need to take action.
You need the right vitamins to thrive in your home life.
This can mean:
Changing things in your home,
Making significant adjustments,
Or even changing homes entirely.
Vitamins are what they are—it is your job to identify the best “vitamins” for you and
take them.
If a vitamin for you is to move to a better home environment,
Or to create better conditions in your current home,
Then that is the step you are being guided to take.
Together, these two cards point to taking deep care of yourself and taking your
health and wellbeing seriously.
The Vitamins can help you improve your home environment and your life overall.
Alternative scenarior
If a person already has harmonious home conditions, is generally healthy, and
thriving, then this card can carry another meaning:
The person themselves is the vitamin.
They function as a nourishing presence for:
their home environment,
their relationships,
and the groups they are part of.
They are a source of replenishment and positive energy for others.
In the context of Home Environment, this could apply to:
Family,
Children,
A spouse or partner,
Close friends,
Or even students, if the person is a teacher.
A teacher, for example, could be a vitamin for the children:
They vibrate light and warmth,
They offer supportive, nourishing energy,
And the children can feed on this energy in the sense of receiving emotional
sustenance.
Children always need support and guidance from adults, and in such a reading, the
Vitamin card signifies that this person is that source of nourishment.

## The Thermometer and Ananda
There is little doubt about the message:
The Thermometer is to be used to identify the vibration of Ananda.
To recognize the vibration of your Higher Self, and to surrender to it.
The guidance is to stop making choices that continue old patterns, ignorance, or
darkness. Instead, it is about creating the opportunity for a transition of
consciousness—a more stable shift into higher awareness, where we can humanize
our spiritual essence and live from it.
This is a beautiful message:
Use the thermometer to pick up on the spiritual essence,
And allow that to guide your choices and align your energy.
An alternative scenario
If the person pulling these cards is in chaos, pain, or deep struggle, they may find it
hard to relate to the higher spiritual message.
They might have real-life challenges,
Conflicts with toxic people,
Difficult family or work situations that demand immediate attention.
When the human pain is very strong, that becomes the focus, and it overshadows the
spiritual essence.
In this case, the guidance shifts:
The person must use the thermometer to identify the source of pain (the
“abscess” or core wound).
Once it is found, surrender it to divine guidance and healing—to the energy of
Ananda.
Practical steps may be required:
End unhealthy relationships or patterns,
Withdraw from toxic environments,
Seek retreat or safe space to reconnect,
Invite high-frequency, healing energy that will also clear the mind, allowing better
decisions and clarity to emerge.
In such cases, Ananda can even be used as a mantra for coping with pain and
invoking healing.

## The Short Journey and The Circle
Together, these cards suggest that:
Gaining clarity over one’s inner climate
Taking responsibility for it
Establishing healthy boundaries
…are essential parts of the life journey at this moment. This is the way to create a
more livable daily life, less influenced by invasive energies from others. With this
comes less pain and greater clarity.
Alternative interpretation
If the person asking already has strong boundaries, lives responsibly with high
consciousness, and is well along the awakening path, then this spread can mean
something else:
They are an important person for others’ journeys out of illusion.
They may work in collaboration or community, bringing upliftment and clarity to
the collective.
It can indicate a strong team, a healthy community, a work environment, or a
project where aligned people work toward a shared goal.
In this sense, the cards show both a personal and a collective path, reflecting inner
strength and positive influence in the world.

## The Mask and The Abuser
The meaning depends on who is asking for the reading.
Scenario 1: If this is someone who genuinely carries the role of the weak link, the
scapegoat, has endured a lot of suffering, is used to giving away their power
and space, and generally may be a people pleaser or even self-sabotaging—
then the “Abuser” card highlights the influence in this person’s life.
The message is clear: they must work on their own boundaries and inner
life. They need to take concrete steps to break free from unhealthy
relationships and people.
It is also crucial to understand that when one validates these limited
roles—like the scapegoat role—one makes oneself a target. It’s as if you’re
pouring out your own water. You become self-offering.
This is when the energy represented by “The Abuser” comes in, in
various forms, to take advantage. They may expect too much, take too much,
treat the person poorly, and essentially use their energy.
Scenario 2: If the person asking does not carry the scapegoat role, things can be
different. They may struggle with honesty themselves. They may have thick
armor, find it hard to be feminine, receptive, vulnerable, or visible.
In this case, they might wear a powerful mask of entitlement and
confidence, being forceful or assertive. Here, the “Abuser” card might reflect
what they themselves could become.
Even though “abuser” is a strong word, it can simply mean overstepping
others’ boundaries and misusing their energy. This comes from a lack of inner
balance and honesty in self-expression, which can harm others.
They might unintentionally become someone others experience as:
an abuser,
an energy thief,
or simply someone they cannot relax around.
The Two Cards as a Wake-Up Call
In this context, the two cards together serve as a wake-up call and a guide to:
Remove the mask
Feel the fresh air
Embrace the freedom and peace that comes with honesty
When one dares to drop the mask and be authentic, they naturally become:
kinder
more transparent
more loving toward others

## Honey Tears and The Flame
speak of enormous potential and powerful forces at work, and that now is truly the
time to surrender even more.
Depending on the person’s question, the interpretation can shift:
If they ask about another person, or about work or something not directly related
to healing, these cards point to perfect constellations and ideal environments
as potential. The person can step into these by being in flow, following
synchronicities, and staying true to themselves — this will draw the right
people to them. The cards also say: let go of the need to control, to search, and
to over-analyze. Instead of weighing every decision back and forth, be more of
a witness and be willing to be unorthodox — to see things in a new way.
This is about forces that work with their own frequency and intelligence, and
surrendering to that is the key.
If the person is in crisis and needs healing, this is an extremely positive card
combination.
If they are asking for inspiration or want to manifest something, the cards say
there is healing power and the ability to tap into what is not commonly
accessed — a depth within themselves that can now be brought to the surface.
This can inspire and allow them to bring something new into the world,
influencing others through creative paintings, music, colors, frequencies, and
sounds — creations that can carry healing for others and have a profound
effect on them.

## Childhood and Freedom to Be Yourself
they say that the solution lies in the childhood. It lies in freeing the child from its
restrictions and the difficulties that have shaped and programmed you as you are
today. If the inner child is still holding onto feelings of being trapped, shamed, or
fearful, it cannot pass through those emotions — and when they arise, they stop you
from moving forward.
These cards say: you were created to move freely, to breathe deeply, to be here in the
present moment. The solution lies in lifting the child up, freeing it from those
circumstances, and allowing the associated difficult feelings to flow through the body
without interference — without resistance, suppression, or judgment.
If, for example, the person asking the question is not working with healing but simply
wants to manifest something or find inspiration, this combination can point toward
all forms of free expression. It could be dance, expressing through music or
movement, or other creative outlets. It can also involve spending time with children,
observing how they behave before they are conditioned — and perhaps even
working with children directly, which can be deeply inspiring and very fitting.
It can refer to anything that encourages free expression — workshops, courses, or
even inspiring others to put down their burdens and embrace greater joy in life.
Together, these cards are joyful: they speak of joy growing and bringing the freedom
to be yourself, and of the many ways this can come into your life.

## Grow Inward and The Window
When Grow Inward and The Window appear together, they tell you not to focus on
others or be overly concerned about what others think, nor to judge them. Instead,
turn your gaze inward, take care of your own matters, and remember that you live
first and foremost within yourself — as does everyone else. We all see, feel, and think
through our own filters.
This awareness prevents misunderstandings and helps you interact on the right
terms.
Depending on the Question
If the person is asking for inspiration — for example, to write — these cards could
suggest writing about cultural differences, the importance of the inner journey
no matter who you are, and the reality that everyone acts from behind their
own filters. When you see clearly, you won’t judge anyone. This can be an
important lesson to share.
If the person is asking about work or making a choice, this can be read as the
card’s direct message: clarity is coming. It’s a positive sign — a “yes” — as
clarity will help you understand where others are coming from. The image of
the window shows that by looking through it, you gain new insight. This
suggests that the clarity you seek will arrive soon.
