  ### EXAMPLES OF SYNTHESIZED READINGS
  ---
  Here are examples of how to synthesize readings from individual card meanings for different card combinations.

  #### TWO CARD COMBINATION EXAMPLE:
  CONTEXT:
  Card Name: Roots
  Interpretation: This card signifies cutting away old patterns. It is a powerful card of new beginnings, signaling a completely different life is on its way because the old karmic cycle has ended.
  ---
  Card Name: Blister
  Interpretation: This card represents repeating the mistakes of the past, like wearing the same old shoes even though you know they give you blisters. It is an urge to learn from life's lessons.
  ---

  SYNTHESIZED READING:
  The appearance of 'Roots' and 'Blister' together brings a profound message about the cycles of your life. There is a powerful opportunity for a new beginning, as 'Roots' suggests you have successfully cut away the old karmic patterns that no longer serve you. However, the 'Blister' serves as a crucial reminder to remain vigilant. It warns against the temptation to step back into old, painful situations—the 'old shoes'—out of habit or comfort. Your task now is to consciously embrace the new path that is opening up for you, trusting that the lessons of the past have been learned and that you deserve to walk forward without the familiar pain of old blisters.

  #### THREE CARD COMBINATION EXAMPLE:
  CONTEXT:
  Card Name: Forest Mist
  Interpretation: This card points to complete confusion and unclear situations where the path forward is obscured.
  ---
  Card Name: Midnight Sun
  Interpretation: This card represents full illumination and clarity that will eventually shine through.
  ---
  Card Name: Pathfinder
  Interpretation: This card is about making conscious choices and finding the right direction.
  ---

  SYNTHESIZED READING:
  The combination of 'Forest Mist', 'Midnight Sun', and 'Pathfinder' tells a story of transformation through confusion to clarity. You may currently find yourself in a fog of uncertainty, where old patterns seem to repeat and the way forward feels unclear. The 'Forest Mist' represents this temporary state of confusion, but 'Midnight Sun' assures you that illumination is coming—the sun is shining behind the clouds and will soon break through. 'Pathfinder' reminds you that you have the power to make conscious choices that will lead you out of this confusion. The key is to not fight against the mist, but to integrate the lessons it brings, knowing that clarity and resolution are on their way.

  #### FIVE CARD COMBINATION EXAMPLE:
  CONTEXT:
  Card Name: The Yellow Light
  Interpretation: This card stands for consciousness, clarity, and having a clear, distinct voice that does things correctly and fairly.
  ---
  Card Name: The Mailbox
  Interpretation: This card means that messages are coming, or help, or something positive that is in your favor.
  ---
  Card Name: Sparkle in the Eye
  Interpretation: This card suggests not overreacting to negative situations and maintaining a sense of lightness and humor.
  ---
  Card Name: Brown Field
  Interpretation: This card represents negative influences or situations that are not working properly.
  ---
  Card Name: Waves in the Sea
  Interpretation: This card means influence from others, often creating unrest or disturbance in your life.
  ---

  SYNTHESIZED READING:
  The five cards together paint a picture of navigating through challenging external influences while maintaining your inner light and receiving support. 'Brown Field' and 'Waves in the Sea' indicate that you're dealing with negative influences from others—perhaps people who create trouble or unrest in your life. However, 'Sparkle in the Eye' advises you not to take this too seriously or overreact to these negative forces. 'The Yellow Light' shows that you have a clear consciousness and noble qualities that help you navigate these challenges with integrity. Most importantly, 'The Mailbox' brings the message that positive help and support are on their way—whether from the universe, other people, or new opportunities that will help balance out the negative influences. The overall message is one of hope and resilience, reminding you that good forces are watching over you and ensuring everything will work out well.
